# Resolving the `net/smtp` Load Error in Rails 7 with Ruby 3.1

## Introduction

When upgrading to Rails 7 and Ruby 3.1, developers may encounter an error stating that the `net/smtp` file cannot be loaded when running tests with RSpec. This issue arises due to significant changes in how Ruby 3.1 handles standard libraries, particularly the `net/smtp`, `net/imap`, and `net/pop` modules, which are no longer included by default. These changes, combined with compatibility adjustments in Rails 7 and related gems like the `mail` gem, can lead to dependency issues and load errors during test execution.

### Background and Context

Ruby 3.1 introduced a more modular approach to its standard library, where certain modules that were previously included by default are now treated as separate gems. This change aims to reduce the size of the default Ruby installation and improve performance. However, it also means that applications and libraries that rely on these modules must explicitly include them in their Gemfile. For Rails 7 applications, this change can be particularly impactful, especially for those using Action Mailer or Action Mailbox, which depend on `net/smtp` for email processing.

### Common Scenarios

The `net/smtp` load error typically manifests in the following scenarios:
- **Upgrading from Rails 6 to Rails 7**: Applications that were previously running on Rails 6 and are now upgraded to Rails 7 may encounter this error if they have not updated their dependencies to reflect the changes in Ruby 3.1.
- **Using RSpec for Testing**: The error often appears during RSpec test runs, particularly when the test environment attempts to load `net/smtp` for email-related tests. This is because the test environment may not have the necessary gems explicitly included, leading to load failures.
- **Action Mailer and Action Mailbox**: Applications that use Action Mailer or Action Mailbox for sending emails are particularly susceptible to this issue, as these components rely on `net/smtp` for SMTP communication.

### Root Causes

The primary root causes of the `net/smtp` load error are:
1. **Ruby 3.1 Standard Library Changes**: Ruby 3.1 no longer includes `net/smtp`, `net/imap`, and `net/pop` in its default gems. These modules must now be explicitly added to the Gemfile.
2. **Dependency Management in Rails 7**: Rails 7, while compatible with Ruby 3.1, may not automatically handle the new dependency requirements. This can lead to missing gems and load errors.
3. **Version Compatibility**: Ensuring that all gems, including `rspec-rails`, `mail`, and `net-smtp`, are compatible with Rails 7 and Ruby 3.1 is crucial. Outdated or incompatible gems can exacerbate the issue.

### Impact and Consequences

The `net/smtp` load error can have several consequences:
- **Test Failures**: RSpec tests that involve email sending or SMTP communication will fail, making it difficult to ensure the application's email functionality is working correctly.
- **Development Delays**: Developers may spend significant time troubleshooting and resolving the error, leading to delays in the development process.
- **Production Issues**: If the issue is not resolved in the test environment, it can propagate to the production environment, potentially causing email delivery failures and other related issues.

### Purpose of This Article

This article aims to provide a comprehensive guide to understanding and resolving the `net/smtp` load error when upgrading to Rails 7 and Ruby 3.1. We will explore the root causes of the error, discuss common scenarios where it occurs, and provide actionable solutions to ensure smooth testing and application functionality. By following the steps outlined in this article, developers can effectively address the `net/smtp` load error and ensure their applications are fully compatible with the latest versions of Rails and Ruby.

## Problem Description

The `net/smtp` load error is a common issue encountered by developers when upgrading to Rails 7 and Ruby 3.1. This error manifests as a `LoadError` during the execution of RSpec tests, typically appearing in the terminal with the following message:

Applications using Action Mailbox or Action Mailer are particularly prone to this error, as these components depend on the `mail` gem, which in turn relies on `net/smtp` for SMTP communication.

## Conclusion

Upgrading to Rails 7 and Ruby 3.1 introduces a series of compatibility challenges, particularly for components that rely on Ruby’s standard libraries like `net/smtp`. The transition to these newer versions necessitates a thorough understanding of the changes and a strategic approach to ensure a smooth migration. By following the outlined solutions, you can effectively resolve the `net/smtp` load error and stabilize your test suite.

### Key Takeaways

1. **Ruby 3.1 Standard Library Changes**:
   - Ruby 3.1 no longer includes `net/smtp`, `net/imap`, and `net/pop` as part of its standard library. These modules are now distributed as separate gems, requiring explicit inclusion in your Gemfile.
   - This change impacts applications using the `mail` gem, which relies on these modules for email handling.

2. **Gem Dependency Conflicts**:
   - Outdated versions of the `mail` gem (≤2.7.1) do not declare dependencies on the `net-smtp`, `net-imap`, and `net-pop` gems. Upgrading to `mail` version 2.8.0+ resolves this issue by explicitly including these dependencies.
   - Ensure that your Rails version is at least 7.0.1, as earlier versions may lack the necessary compatibility fixes for Ruby 3.1.

3. **Autoloading and Test Environment Setup**:
   - Rails 7 enforces stricter autoloading rules with Zeitwerk, which can affect how `net/smtp` is loaded during tests. Ensure your application adheres to Zeitwerk conventions to avoid path-related errors.
   - Proper configuration of RSpec and the test environment is crucial. Verify that `rspec-rails` is version 7.x and that your test setup correctly loads all necessary dependencies.

### Practical Steps for Resolution

1. **Add `net-smtp` to the Gemfile Temporarily**:
   - Explicitly add the `net-smtp`, `net-imap`, and `net-pop` gems to your Gemfile with `require: false` to ensure they are included in the dependency graph:
     ```ruby
     gem 'net-smtp', require: false
     gem 'net-imap', require: false
     gem 'net-pop', require: false
     ```
   - Run `bundle install` to install the gems.

2. **Update the `mail` Gem**:
   - Upgrade the `mail` gem to version 2.8.0 or higher, which explicitly depends on the `net-smtp`, `net-imap`, and `net-pop` gems:
     ```ruby
     gem 'mail', '>= 2.8.0'
     ```

3. **Ensure Rails Version Compatibility**:
   - Upgrade Rails to version 7.0.1 or higher to benefit from Ruby 3.1 compatibility fixes:
     ```bash
     bundle update rails
     ```

4. **Check `rspec-rails` Version**:
   - Use `rspec-rails` version 7.x to ensure compatibility with Rails 7.x:
     ```ruby
     gem 'rspec-rails', '~> 7.0.0'
     ```

5. **Restart Test Runner and Clear Caches**:
   - Restart the test runner and clear any cached paths (e.g., `bootsnap` caches) to ensure fresh loading:
     ```bash
     rm -rf tmp/cache
     bin/rspec
     ```

6. **Configure Action Mailer in Test Environment**:
   - Set `config.action_mailer.delivery_method = :test` in `config/environments/test.rb` to avoid unnecessary SMTP interactions during testing:
     ```ruby
     Rails.application.configure do
       config.action_mailer.delivery_method = :test
       config.action_mailer.smtp_settings = {
         address: "localhost",
         port: 1025,
         timeout: 5
       }
     end
     ```

7. **Update Other Dependencies**:
   - Audit your Gemfile.lock for outdated gems that might conflict with Ruby 3.1 or Rails 7. Update or remove such gems to allow dependency resolution.

### Advanced Considerations

1. **Gem Version Locking**:
   - If upgrading the `mail` gem causes compatibility issues, lock it to version 2.7.1 and explicitly add the `net-smtp` gem. Specify the `net-smtp` version compatible with your Ruby version (e.g., `0.3.1` for Ruby 3.1.x).

2. **RubyGems and Bundler Updates**:
   - Ensure RubyGems and Bundler are up-to-date to avoid path resolution issues:
     ```bash
     gem update --system
     gem install bundler
     ```

3. **Alternative Email Libraries**:
   - Consider using third-party email service integrations (e.g., SendGrid, Postmark) to bypass dependency issues entirely. These gems handle delivery through external APIs rather than relying on `net/smtp`.

4. **Zeitwerk Configuration**:
   - Ensure all application files follow the `lib` directory structure (no `lib/` in `$LOAD_PATH`) and use proper naming conventions. Zeitwerk autoloading requires strict adherence to these rules to prevent conflicts.

5. **Gem Conflict Resolution**:
   - Use `bundle outdated` to identify gems with incompatible versions. Update or remove such gems to allow dependency resolution.

6. **Ruby Version Pinning**:
   - Test with Ruby 3.2+ to see if newer Ruby versions resolve the issue. Newer Rubies may include updated `net/smtp` versions or improved dependency handling.

### Final Thoughts

By proactively auditing dependencies and adhering to Rails 7’s autoloading conventions, you can mitigate the risks of similar issues in the future. If the problem persists, consider reaching out to the Rails or RSpec communities with detailed logs and environment configurations for tailored assistance. The community is a valuable resource for troubleshooting and staying informed about the latest best practices and updates.
