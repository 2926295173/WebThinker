Question: How can I effectively adapt dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) skills training to accommodate a client with co-occurring borderline personality disorder and high-functioning autism, given the unique challenges presented by the client's rigid thinking patterns and difficulty with group social interactions?

# Adapting DBT Skills Training for Clients with Co-Occurring Borderline Personality Disorder and High-Functioning Autism: A Comprehensive Guide

## Introduction

Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) is a widely recognized evidence-based treatment for Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD), focusing on emotion regulation, distress tolerance, mindfulness, and interpersonal effectiveness. Originally developed by Dr. Marsha Linehan, DBT has been adapted and expanded to address various mental health conditions, including Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). However, clients with co-occurring BPD and high-functioning autism (HFA) present unique challenges that can hinder the traditional implementation of DBT. These challenges include rigid thinking patterns and difficulty with group social interactions, which can complicate the therapeutic process.

Rigid thinking, a hallmark of HFA, often conflicts with DBT’s emphasis on flexibility and dialectical synthesis. Individuals with HFA may struggle to grasp abstract concepts and may find it difficult to shift their perspectives, which are essential components of DBT. Additionally, social interaction difficulties, such as challenges in understanding social cues and initiating conversations, can make group-based skill training particularly challenging. These barriers necessitate tailored adaptations to ensure that DBT remains effective and accessible for this population.

This article synthesizes clinical guidelines, case studies, and expert recommendations to provide a comprehensive roadmap for adapting DBT skills training to accommodate the unique needs of clients with co-occurring BPD and HFA. By integrating neurodiversity-affirming strategies, sensory accommodations, and structured interventions, therapists can optimize DBT’s effectiveness for clients navigating both conditions. Key adaptations include the use of visual aids to make abstract concepts more concrete, individualized pacing to accommodate cognitive processing differences, and modifications to group dynamics to reduce overwhelm. Trauma-informed approaches that validate neurodivergent experiences are also crucial, as many individuals with BPD and HFA have experienced trauma.

## Challenges in Treating Co-occurring BPD and HFA

Clients with both Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) and high-functioning autism (HFA) face a unique set of challenges that complicate the standard delivery of Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT). These challenges stem from the distinct cognitive, emotional, and social profiles of each condition, which can interact in complex ways, making traditional DBT approaches less effective or even counterproductive.

### Rigid Thinking Patterns

Rigid thinking, a hallmark of HFA, can significantly impede the effectiveness of DBT. Autistic individuals often exhibit cognitive rigidity, which can manifest as difficulty accepting contradictory perspectives, resisting behavioral change, or fixating on perfectionism. This rigidity can make it challenging for clients to engage with DBT’s core concepts, such as the "wise mind," which emphasizes balancing rational and emotional responses. For HFA clients, the idea of integrating these perspectives may be perceived as a demand to suppress their natural ways of thinking and feeling, leading to resistance and potential alienation from the therapy.

### Emotional Dysregulation and Social Anxiety

BPD is characterized by intense emotional dysregulation and a profound fear of abandonment, which can exacerbate the social anxieties already present in HFA. The emotional volatility of BPD can intensify the social withdrawal and avoidance behaviors common in HFA, creating a cycle of social isolation and emotional distress. For example, an HFA client with BPD may experience heightened anxiety in social situations, leading to avoidance of group therapy sessions, which are a crucial component of DBT. This avoidance can further isolate the client, making it difficult to build the social skills and support networks necessary for recovery.

### Group Social Interactions

Group social interactions pose a significant challenge for clients with co-occurring BPD and HFA. Autistic individuals often struggle with interpreting nonverbal cues, managing sensory overload in group environments, and participating in unstructured discussions. These difficulties can be compounded by BPD’s interpersonal sensitivity, leading to overwhelming anxiety and discomfort in group settings. For instance, an HFA client with BPD may find it particularly challenging to navigate the rapid and unpredictable nature of group interactions, which can trigger sensory overload and emotional dysregulation. This can result in a cycle of social withdrawal and emotional escalation, further hindering the client's ability to benefit from group therapy.

### Overlapping Symptoms and Differential Diagnosis

The overlapping symptoms of BPD and HFA, such as impulsivity and self-harm behaviors, require careful differentiation to avoid pathologizing neurodivergent traits. For example, self-harm in HFA may be a response to sensory overload or emotional distress, rather than a symptom of BPD. Clinicians must be adept at distinguishing between these behaviors to provide appropriate and effective interventions. Misdiagnosis or overpathologization can lead to ineffective treatment and may even exacerbate the client's distress.

### Dialectical Tension in DBT

DBT inherently involves a dialectical tension between "change" and "acceptance." While DBT encourages clients to adopt new behaviors and skills, HFA clients may prioritize consistency and routine, which are essential for their sense of security and predictability. This conflict demands a nuanced approach that respects the client's neurodivergent identity while fostering skill acquisition. For instance, therapists may need to adapt the pace and structure of DBT modules to accommodate the client's cognitive and sensory needs, ensuring that the therapy is both accessible and meaningful.

### Thorough Assessment and Individualized Treatment

Finally, the co-occurring nature of BPD and HFA necessitates thorough assessment to distinguish between symptoms of each condition. Comprehensive evaluations should include a detailed history of the client's developmental, emotional, and social experiences to identify the unique challenges they face. This assessment informs the development of an individualized treatment plan that addresses both conditions simultaneously. For example, a client with co-occurring BPD and HFA may benefit from a combination of individual therapy, modified group sessions, and sensory accommodations to manage their symptoms effectively.

### Summary of Challenges

| **Challenge** | **Impact on DBT** | **Example** |
|---------------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Rigid Thinking** | Difficulty accepting DBT concepts, resistance to change | Misinterpreting "wise mind" as a demand to suppress autistic traits |
| **Emotional Dysregulation** | Intensified social anxiety, avoidance of group settings | Heightened anxiety leading to social withdrawal |
| **Group Social Interactions** | Sensory overload, difficulty interpreting nonverbal cues | Overwhelming anxiety in group therapy sessions |
| **Overlapping Symptoms** | Risk of misdiagnosis, overpathologization | Self-harm as a response to sensory overload |
| **Dialectical Tension** | Conflict between "change" and "acceptance" | Need for adapted pacing and structure in DBT modules |
| **Thorough Assessment** | Necessary to distinguish between BPD and HFA symptoms | Comprehensive evaluations to inform individualized treatment |

In summary, treating clients with co-occurring BPD and HFA requires a multifaceted approach that addresses the unique cognitive, emotional, and social challenges of each condition. By recognizing and respecting the client's neurodivergent identity, therapists can adapt DBT to be more effective and supportive, ultimately enhancing the client's quality of life and well-being.

## Adapting DBT to Address Rigid Thinking Patterns

Rigid thinking in high-functioning autism (HFA) requires modifications to DBT’s abstract concepts and dialectical processes. Clients with HFA often struggle with abstract reasoning, problem-solving, and flexible thinking, which can hinder the effectiveness of standard DBT interventions. The following strategies can help adapt DBT to better address these challenges:

### 1. Visual and Sensory-Based Learning

#### Graphic Organizers
Visual aids such as flowcharts and color-coded charts can significantly enhance the understanding and retention of DBT skills. For example, the concept of "Wise Mind" can be depicted as a decision-making algorithm, where the client is guided through a series of steps to balance rational and emotional responses. This visual representation helps make the abstract concept more concrete and easier to follow.

#### Concrete Examples
Replace metaphors and abstract concepts with literal explanations. For instance, instead of using the term "radical acceptance," explain it as "observing facts without judgment." Pair this explanation with written exercises or logic puzzles to reinforce the idea. This approach ensures that the client can grasp the concept in a way that aligns with their cognitive strengths.

### 2. Structured Step-by-Step Instruction

#### Sequential, Incremental Steps
Deliver DBT skills in sequential, incremental steps to accommodate the client's need for predictability and structure. For example, when teaching "distress tolerance," start with physiological grounding techniques (e.g., the TIP skill: Temperature, Intense exercise, Paced breathing) before moving on to emotional acceptance. This step-by-step approach helps the client build a solid foundation before tackling more complex skills.

#### Written Agendas and Checklists
Provide written agendas and checklists for each session to align with the client's preference for predictability. These tools can help the client stay organized and focused, reducing anxiety and cognitive overload. For instance, a session might begin with a brief review of the previous session, followed by a new skill introduction, practice, and a summary of key takeaways.

### 3. Radically Open DBT (RO-DBT) Integration

#### Flexibility Training
RO-DBT, designed for overcontrolled traits, can complement standard DBT by emphasizing flexibility training. This includes practicing uncertainty tolerance and openness to emotional experience. For example, clients can engage in exercises that encourage them to explore new perspectives or try new activities, gradually building their ability to handle ambiguity and change.

#### Openness to Emotional Experience
RO-DBT also focuses on fostering a more open and accepting attitude toward emotional experiences. This can be particularly beneficial for clients with HFA, who may struggle with recognizing and expressing their emotions. Techniques such as "open awareness" and "radical openness" can help clients become more attuned to their emotional states and develop healthier coping mechanisms.

### 4. Collaborative Concept Reconceptualization

#### Co-Creating Metaphors and Analogies
Collaborate with the client to co-create metaphors and analogies that resonate with their experiences and interests. For example, frame "mindfulness" as "focusing on one sensory input at a time," which aligns with their strengths in attention to detail. This personalized approach can make the concepts more relatable and easier to understand.

#### Tailored Examples
Use examples that are relevant to the client's life and interests. For instance, if the client is passionate about coding, use coding analogies to explain DBT skills. This not only increases engagement but also helps the client see the practical applications of the skills in their daily life.

### 5. Technology and Special Interests

#### Gamification
Gamify DBT skills using the client's special interests to increase engagement. For example, if the client enjoys coding, create a coding project that incorporates DBT skills. Apps like *SkillStorm* or *Autism Coach* can provide visual prompts and interactive exercises that make skill practice more engaging and fun.

#### Video Modeling
Use video modeling to demonstrate DBT skills, leveraging the client's visual learning strengths. Videos can show step-by-step instructions and real-life examples, making it easier for the client to understand and practice the skills. This approach can be particularly effective for clients who benefit from visual and concrete demonstrations.

### 6. Reduced Ambiguity

#### Simplified Questions
Simplify open-ended questions to closed ones to reduce ambiguity. For example, instead of asking, "What do you feel?" ask, "Rate your anger on a scale of 1–10." This approach provides a clear and structured way for the client to express their emotions, reducing the cognitive load and anxiety associated with open-ended questions.

#### Pre-Defined Roles and Expectations
Pre-define roles and expectations in role-play exercises to minimize confusion and anxiety. For example, provide a script or a set of predefined scenarios that the client can practice. This structure helps the client feel more comfortable and confident in the role-play, making it a more effective learning experience.

### Summary

These adaptations ensure that rigid thinking patterns are respected as part of the client’s neurodivergent identity while gradually introducing flexibility and emotional regulation strategies critical for BPD symptom management. By using visual and sensory-based learning, structured step-by-step instruction, RO-DBT integration, collaborative concept reconceptualization, technology and special interests, and reduced ambiguity, therapists can create a more inclusive and effective DBT program for clients with co-occurring BPD and HFA.

## Modifying Group Social Interactions in DBT for HFA Clients

Traditional Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) groups, which rely heavily on peer interaction and discussion, can be overwhelming for clients with high-functioning autism (HFA). These clients often struggle with interpreting nonverbal cues, managing sensory overload, and participating in unstructured discussions. To make DBT groups more accessible and effective, clinicians can implement several key adjustments:

### 1. Small Group Sizes

**Reducing Group Size to 3–4 Members:**
- **Decrease Social Anxiety:** Smaller groups reduce the number of social interactions, making the environment less overwhelming for HFA clients.
- **Increase Individualized Attention:** With fewer participants, therapists can provide more personalized attention, ensuring that each client receives the support they need.
- **Enhance Engagement:** Smaller groups allow for more focused and structured interactions, which can help HFA clients feel more comfortable and engaged.

### 2. Structured Agendas and Visual Aids

**Written Agendas and Visual Timers:**
- **Predictability:** Begin each session with a written agenda that outlines the topics and activities. This helps HFA clients know what to expect, reducing anxiety.
- **Visual Timers:** Use visual timers to indicate the duration of each activity, providing a clear structure and helping clients manage their time.
- **Graphic Organizers:** Use graphic organizers to map out group discussions. For example, a flowchart can help visualize the steps in a distress tolerance exercise, making the process more concrete and understandable.

**Written Summaries:**
- **Reinforcement:** Provide written summaries of the session’s key points and activities. This helps HFA clients review and internalize the skills learned, reinforcing their understanding.

### 3. Pre-Session Preparation

**Pre-Meeting Emails and Materials:**
- **Preparation:** Send pre-meeting emails or materials that outline the topics, expected activities, and any social roles. For example, an email might state, “Your task: Share one grounding technique you practiced this week.”
- **Reducing Uncertainty:** This preparation helps HFA clients feel more prepared and confident, reducing the anxiety associated with unexpected social demands.

### 4. Alternative Participation Options

**Non-Verbal Participation:**
- **Whiteboards and Emojis:** Allow clients to write their responses on whiteboards or use emojis to express emotions. This provides alternative ways to participate without the pressure of verbal communication.
- **Pass Tokens:** Offer “pass” tokens that clients can use to opt-out of uncomfortable discussions. This gives them a sense of control and reduces the stress of feeling forced to participate.

### 5. Sensory-Friendly Environments

**Modifying Group Settings:**
- **Dimming Lights and Reducing Noise:** Adjust the lighting and noise levels in the therapy room to create a more calming environment. Use dimmer switches and noise-cancelling headphones if necessary.
- **Sensory Tools:** Provide sensory tools such as fidget toys, weighted blankets, or scented objects to help clients manage sensory overload.
- **Low-Stimulation Rooms:** Schedule sessions in low-stimulation rooms that are free from distractions and sensory triggers.
- **Sensory Breaks:** Permit brief sensory breaks during discussions. This allows clients to step away and regroup, reducing the risk of sensory overload.

### 6. Role-Play with Scripts and Video Modeling

**Structured Role-Play Scenarios:**
- **Explicit Scripts:** Use written scripts to structure role-play scenarios. For example, provide a script for practicing assertiveness, such as “Practice saying ‘no’ calmly” with clear steps and objectives.
- **Video Modeling:** Use video modeling to demonstrate interactions before live practice. This helps HFA clients visualize and understand the expected behaviors, making the role-play more effective.

### 7. Individualized Follow-Up

**Pairing Group Sessions with Individual Coaching:**
- **Debriefing:** Pair group sessions with individual coaching to debrief experiences and adjust strategies. This allows clients to discuss any challenges they faced and receive personalized feedback.
- **Adjusting Strategies:** Use individual sessions to tailor DBT skills to the client’s specific needs and preferences, ensuring that the group experience is as beneficial as possible.

### 8. Technology Integration

**Virtual Group Sessions and Hybrid Formats:**
- **Virtual Platforms:** Consider virtual group sessions or hybrid formats that combine in-person and online participation. Platforms like Zoom allow clients to control their environment, mute themselves when overwhelmed, and use the chat feature to participate non-verbally.
- **Flexibility:** Virtual sessions can be particularly helpful for clients who find in-person interactions challenging. They provide a more controlled and predictable environment, reducing social anxiety.

### Summary

By implementing these modifications, clinicians can create a more inclusive and effective DBT group environment for clients with high-functioning autism (HFA). Prioritizing predictability, reducing sensory and social demands, and offering flexibility ensures that HFA clients can fully engage in the therapeutic process while retaining the therapeutic value of DBT for managing BPD symptoms. These adaptations not only make the group setting more accessible but also enhance the overall effectiveness of the treatment.

## Integrating CBT and Radically Open DBT (RO-DBT) Principles

While Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) is rooted in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), clients with co-occurring Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) and high-functioning autism (HFA) may benefit from hybrid approaches that blend DBT’s core modules with adaptations from CBT and Radically Open Dialectical Behavior Therapy (RO-DBT). This integration ensures that the therapy acknowledges the client’s neurodivergent identity while addressing BPD-driven emotional and behavioral challenges.

### 1. CBT-Informed Modifications

#### Cognitive Restructuring
CBT’s cognitive restructuring techniques can be particularly useful for clients with HFA, who often struggle with rigid thinking patterns. By using explicit, fact-based methods, therapists can help clients challenge and reframe maladaptive beliefs. For example, a client who believes, “I must never feel angry,” can be guided to replace this belief with, “Anger is a normal emotion, and I can choose calm actions to manage it.” This approach helps clients understand that emotions are valid and can be managed constructively, reducing the pressure to suppress or deny their feelings.

#### Social Stories and Scripts
Social stories and scripts are effective tools for reducing ambiguity and enhancing social skills in HFA clients. These written or visual scripts can provide clear, step-by-step guidance for social interactions, such as starting a conversation, maintaining eye contact, or responding to social cues. For instance, a social story might outline the steps for initiating a conversation: “1. Approach the person with a friendly smile. 2. Say ‘Hi, my name is [Name].’ 3. Ask a simple question like ‘How are you today?’” This structured approach helps clients feel more confident and prepared in social situations, reducing anxiety and improving social engagement.

### 2. RO-DBT Integration for Overcontrol

#### Uncertainty Tolerance Exercises
RO-DBT is specifically designed to address overcontrol, a common trait in HFA characterized by excessive self-restraint and inflexibility. Uncertainty tolerance exercises can help clients gradually build adaptability and reduce rigidity. For example, therapists might introduce small, controlled changes to the therapy routine, such as altering the seating arrangement or the order of activities. Over time, these exercises can help clients become more comfortable with unpredictability and develop a more flexible mindset.

#### Emotional Expression Practices
HFA clients often struggle with expressing emotions, which can lead to emotional suppression and increased stress. RO-DBT encourages clients to practice sharing their feelings in structured formats, such as writing them down or using visual aids. For instance, a client might be asked to write a journal entry about their emotions each day or use an emotion wheel to identify and label their feelings. These practices help clients become more aware of their emotional experiences and develop healthier ways to express and manage their emotions.

#### Non-Judgmental Self-Reflection
RO-DBT emphasizes non-judgmental self-reflection, which is particularly important for clients with HFA who may view their rigidity as a flaw. Therapists can help clients reframe their rigid thinking as a strength, such as attention to detail or consistency. For example, a client who is highly organized and detail-oriented can be encouraged to see these traits as valuable assets rather than weaknesses. This approach fosters self-acceptance and reduces the internal pressure to conform to neurotypical norms.

### 3. Balancing Change and Acceptance

#### Validating Routine While Introducing Variations
DBT’s dialectical framework emphasizes the balance between change and acceptance. For clients with HFA, this balance is crucial, as they often rely on routines and predictability. Therapists can validate the client’s need for routine while gently introducing variations to build flexibility. For example, a therapist might say, “I understand that your routine helps you feel safe and in control. Let’s try a small change, like taking a different route to the therapy session, and see how it feels.” This approach respects the client’s need for structure while gradually expanding their comfort zone.

#### Behavioral Experiments
Behavioral experiments are a powerful tool for testing assumptions and building flexibility. Clients can be encouraged to try new coping strategies in a safe, structured way and report the outcomes. For instance, a client who avoids social interactions due to anxiety might be asked to try a new relaxation technique before a social event and note how it affects their experience. This process helps clients gather evidence about the effectiveness of different strategies and build confidence in their ability to manage challenging situations.

### 4. Trauma-Informed Adaptations

#### Recognizing Trauma
Many autistic individuals with BPD have experienced trauma due to societal invalidation or the need to mask their autistic traits. Trauma-informed practices are essential to ensure that therapy is non-threatening and supportive. Therapists can integrate safety planning and grounding techniques to help clients manage trauma-related symptoms. For example, a safety plan might include a list of trusted contacts, coping strategies, and emergency resources. Grounding techniques, such as deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, or sensory grounding (e.g., focusing on a favorite texture or sound), can help clients stay present and calm during therapy sessions.

#### Creating a Safe and Supportive Environment
A trauma-informed approach also involves creating a safe and supportive therapeutic environment. This includes validating the client’s experiences, avoiding retraumatization, and fostering a sense of trust and collaboration. Therapists can use affirming language, provide clear and consistent communication, and involve the client in decision-making processes. For instance, a therapist might say, “I hear that you’ve had difficult experiences in the past. Let’s work together to create a therapy plan that feels safe and supportive for you.”

### Summary

By integrating CBT and RO-DBT principles into DBT, therapists can create a more tailored and effective treatment approach for clients with co-occurring BPD and HFA. CBT-informed modifications, such as cognitive restructuring and social stories, help address rigid thinking and social challenges. RO-DBT strategies, including uncertainty tolerance exercises and emotional expression practices, target overcontrol and promote flexibility. Balancing change and acceptance through validating routines and behavioral experiments ensures that therapy respects the client’s neurodivergent identity while fostering growth. Finally, trauma-informed adaptations create a safe and supportive environment, essential for clients who have experienced trauma. This hybrid approach enhances the therapeutic alliance and improves outcomes for clients navigating the complexities of both conditions.

## Case Studies and Clinical Examples

A growing body of case studies and clinical trials demonstrates the potential of DBT adaptations for clients with co-occurring Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) and High-Functioning Autism (HFA). These examples highlight the importance of client-driven adaptations, structured environments, and the integration of Radically Open Dialectical Behavior Therapy (RO-DBT) principles to effectively address the unique challenges of these conditions.

### Case Example: Brittany (HFA and BPD)

**Context**:  
Brittany is a 21-year-old woman with a diagnosis of both HFA and BPD. She experiences intense emotional swings and significant difficulty tolerating social unpredictability, which often leads to social withdrawal and self-harm behaviors.

**Adaptations**:
- **Visual Emotion Charts**: To help Brittany label and quantify her emotions, the therapist introduced visual emotion charts. These charts allowed her to rate her emotions on a scale (e.g., “anger level 7/10”) during sessions, making it easier for her to articulate her feelings and track her emotional states.
- **RO-DBT for Rigidity**: To address her rigid thinking patterns, the therapist incorporated RO-DBT techniques. Brittany was taught to tolerate uncertainty through structured exercises, such as “planned surprises” (e.g., the therapist switching a small agenda item without prior notice). This helped her gradually become more flexible and open to change.
- **Individualized Group Prep**: To reduce anxiety and enhance her participation in group sessions, Brittany received pre-session emails outlining the topics and roles for each session. This allowed her to mentally prepare and feel more in control of the group dynamics.

**Outcome**:  
Over time, Brittany experienced a significant reduction in self-harm episodes. She also improved her ability to articulate her emotions without rigidity, leading to better emotional regulation and more effective communication in social settings.

### Randomized Controlled Trial (Web Page 2)

**Context**:  
A 2024 randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluated the effectiveness of DBT for 128 autistic adults with BPD-like traits. The study aimed to assess whether DBT adaptations could reduce suicidal ideation and depression in this population.

**Adaptations**:
- **Custom Workbooks**: The study provided participants with custom DBT workbooks that included visual aids and simplified language. These materials were designed to make abstract concepts more concrete and accessible.
- **Sensory-Friendly Group Sessions**: To accommodate sensory sensitivities, the group sessions were modified to be sensory-friendly. This included reducing the session duration to 2.5 hours twice weekly and providing sensory accommodations (e.g., noise-canceling headphones, fidget toys).
- **Collaborative Goal-Setting**: Participants were involved in setting their own therapy goals, which were often aligned with their personal interests (e.g., using a favorite hobby to practice mindfulness). This increased their motivation and engagement in the therapy process.

**Outcome**:  
The study found that DBT significantly reduced suicidal ideation and depression in the participants. Participants reported improved emotional regulation, better social functioning, and a greater sense of self-acceptance. The adaptations made the therapy more accessible and effective for this population.

### Emerald Insight Case Vignette (Web Page 9)

**Context**:  
An autistic client with BPD comorbidity struggled with social interactions and emotional dysregulation. The therapist implemented several adaptations to address these challenges.

**Adaptations**:
- **Scripted Role-Plays**: The therapist designed role-play scenarios around the client’s interest in science fiction. Using character dialogues, the client practiced assertiveness and social skills in a structured and predictable format.
- **Daily Mood Tracking Apps**: To help the client monitor his emotional fluctuations, the therapist recommended using a daily mood tracking app. This tool allowed the client to log his emotions and track patterns over time, reducing the need for verbal recall and providing a visual representation of his emotional states.

**Outcome**:  
The client showed significant improvement in his social interactions. He became more confident in asserting himself and managing his emotions. The use of scripted role-plays and mood tracking apps provided him with practical tools to navigate social situations and regulate his emotions effectively.

### Summary

These case studies and clinical examples underscore the importance of **client-driven adaptations** in DBT for clients with co-occurring BPD and HFA. By creating structured environments, using visual and sensory-based learning tools, and integrating RO-DBT principles, therapists can effectively address the unique challenges of these conditions. The success of these adaptations highlights the need for a flexible and personalized approach to therapy, ensuring that clients receive the support they need to improve their emotional regulation, social skills, and overall quality of life.

## Considerations for Therapist Practice

Implementing these adaptations requires a nuanced and flexible approach from therapists. The following considerations can help therapists effectively integrate these strategies into their practice:

### 1. Comprehensive Assessment
