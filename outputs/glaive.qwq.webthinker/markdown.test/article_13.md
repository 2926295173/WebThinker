Question: How might the incorporation of sulfur-rich presolar grains into the early solar nebula have influenced the subsequent condensation of refractory elements, such as calcium and aluminum, and what implications does this have for our understanding of the isotopic heterogeneities observed in calcium-aluminum-rich inclusions (CAIs) from the Allende meteorite?

# The Impact of Sulfur-Rich Presolar Grains on the Condensation of Refractory Elements and Isotopic Heterogeneities in Allende CAIs

## Introduction

The early solar nebula was a dynamic environment where the incorporation of presolar grains played a critical role in shaping the chemical and isotopic diversity observed in primitive solar system materials, such as calcium-aluminum-rich inclusions (CAIs). Presolar grains, which are stardust particles that condensed in the ejecta or outflows of dying stars, carry the nucleosynthetic fingerprints of their parent stars. Among these grains, sulfur-rich varieties—particularly silicon carbide (SiC) grains from born-again asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars and supernova (SN)-derived grains—are notable for their distinct isotopic signatures, including excesses of <sup>32</sup>S. These grains likely introduced heterogeneous nucleosynthetic components into the nebula, influencing the condensation of refractory elements like calcium (Ca) and aluminum (Al).

CAIs, as the oldest solids in the solar system, are believed to form through high-temperature condensation processes from a solar-composition gas. However, their isotopic heterogeneities defy simple closed-system models. For instance, the Allende meteorite, a well-studied carbonaceous chondrite, contains CAIs with large variations in oxygen (<sup>16</sup>O-rich vs. <sup>17</sup>,<sup>18</sup>O-enriched), titanium (<sup>50</sup>Ti excesses), and calcium (<sup>48</sup>Ca anomalies). These anomalies are often attributed to contributions from presolar grains, but the precise mechanisms remain debated. The isotopic heterogeneities in CAIs suggest that they formed in a chemically and isotopically heterogeneous nebula, influenced by the mixing of materials from different stellar sources.

Recent studies suggest that sulfur-rich presolar grains, through their isotopic compositions and mineralogical properties, may have directly impacted the condensation dynamics of refractory elements. For example, the decay of <sup>32</sup>Si—a neutron-rich isotope produced in SN explosions—into <sup>32</sup>S could leave detectable sulfur isotopic signatures in CAIs. Additionally, sulfur's role in forming sulfide minerals (e.g., CaS, FeS) might have altered the availability of Ca and Al for condensation into CAI phases like hibonite and grossite. The presence of these sulfides could have influenced the condensation sequence, leading to the observed isotopic and mineralogical variations in CAIs.

Understanding the interplay between sulfur-rich presolar grains and CAI formation is essential for unraveling the early solar system's isotopic reservoirs and the extent of nebular mixing. This article examines how sulfur-rich presolar grains influenced the condensation of refractory elements and their isotopic heterogeneities in CAIs from the Allende meteorite. By integrating insights from presolar grain studies, nebula condensation models, and isotopic analyses of meteoritic inclusions, this research aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the early solar nebula's chemical and isotopic evolution.

This article will delve into these aspects, providing a detailed analysis of the impact of sulfur-rich presolar grains on the early solar nebula and the formation of CAIs.

## Formation and Characteristics of Sulfur-Rich Presolar Grains

Sulfur-rich presolar grains, such as silicon carbide (SiC) grains of Type AB and certain composite grains, originate primarily from two stellar sources: born-again asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars undergoing Very Late Thermal Pulses (VLTPs) and Type II supernovae (SN II). These grains are characterized by their distinct isotopic signatures and mineralogical properties, which provide valuable insights into the nucleosynthetic processes in their parent stars and their role in the early solar nebula.

### Born-Again AGB Stars

Born-again AGB stars experience late-stage helium shell flashes that rejuvenate their stellar envelopes, creating extreme conditions for the synthesis of light s-process elements. The resulting sulfur-rich SiC grains (Type AB) exhibit low <sup>¹²</sup>C/<sup>¹³</sup>C ratios and significant <sup>³²</sup>S excesses. The <sup>³²</sup>S anomaly arises from the decay of <sup>³²</sup>Si, a short-lived radioactive isotope produced during explosive outer-layer mixing in these stars. Unlike mainstream SiC grains from regular AGB stars, Type AB grains lack the typical <sup>²⁶</sup>Al/<sup>²⁷</sup>Al ratios seen in SN grains, indicating their distinct origin. These grains are believed to form in the outflows of born-again AGB stars, where the high temperatures and neutron fluxes facilitate the production of isotopic anomalies.

### Supernova-Derived Grains

Type II supernovae (SN II) ejecta produce a subset of sulfur-rich presolar grains, including X-type and C-type SiC grains. These grains display sulfur isotopic anomalies (e.g., <sup>³²</sup>S excesses) linked to neutron-rich nucleosynthetic events during supernova explosions. For example, the C-type grain exhibits a δ<sup>³⁴</sup>S of -450‰, while X-type grains show δ<sup>³⁴</sup>S around -300‰, both far from solar values. Additionally, some SN-derived SiC grains contain embedded CaS subgrains, which may influence local Ca availability during condensation. The high-energy environment of supernovae allows for the production of a wide range of isotopic anomalies, making these grains valuable tracers of stellar nucleosynthesis.

### Mineralogical and Structural Features

Sulfur-rich presolar grains are typically submicrometer-sized, with Type AB grains forming in high-temperature stellar environments. Their structure often includes amorphous glassy mantles (GEMS grains) adhering to crystalline cores, suggesting formation in both steady-state stellar outflows and explosive events. Despite their small size, these grains are highly resistant to evaporation in the solar nebula, surviving to be incorporated into CAIs. The presence of amorphous mantles and crystalline cores indicates a complex formation history, with grains potentially undergoing multiple stages of condensation and reprocessing.

### Isotopic Signatures

Beyond sulfur anomalies, these grains carry isotopic fingerprints in other elements. For instance, SN-derived grains show excesses of <sup>²⁶</sup>Mg (from <sup>²⁶</sup>Al decay) and <sup>⁵⁰</sup>Ti, while born-again AGB grains may contribute <sup>⁴⁴</sup>Ca and <sup>⁴⁴</sup>Ti. Such multi-element anomalies suggest that sulfur-rich grains acted as vectors for nucleosynthetic diversity in the early solar system. The isotopic signatures of these grains provide a record of the conditions in their parent stars, including the temperatures, pressures, and neutron fluxes that influenced their formation.

### Importance in the Solar Nebula

The survival of sulfur-rich presolar grains in the nebula implies they were protected from prolonged high-temperature exposure, possibly by rapid cooling or incorporation into aggregates. The delivery of these grains into CAI-forming regions could have introduced localized compositional and isotopic variations, influencing the condensation of refractory elements like Ca and Al. The presence of these grains in CAIs suggests that they played a role in the early solar system's chemical and isotopic evolution, contributing to the observed heterogeneities in meteoritic inclusions. The isotopic and mineralogical characteristics of sulfur-rich presolar grains provide a window into the processes that shaped the early solar nebula and the formation of the first solids in the solar system.

The formation and characteristics of sulfur-rich presolar grains highlight their critical role in the early solar system, providing a rich source of information about stellar nucleosynthesis and the processes that shaped the solar nebula. Understanding these grains is essential for unraveling the complex history of the solar system's formation and the origins of its isotopic heterogeneities.

## Early Solar Nebula Conditions and Condensation of Refractory Elements

The early solar nebula was a high-temperature environment where the condensation of refractory elements like calcium (Ca) and aluminum (Al) occurred in distinct sequences. Initial condensation models assumed a homogeneous solar gas composition, but recent evidence reveals significant isotopic heterogeneity, necessitating revisions to account for presolar grain contributions.

### Thermal and Chemical Environment

- **Temperatures and Initial Phases**:  
  The inner regions of the early solar nebula experienced temperatures exceeding **~1400 K**, which were conducive to the condensation of refractory elements. At these high temperatures, minerals like **hibonite (CaAl₁₂O₁₉)** and **grossite (CaAl₂SiO₄)** were among the first to form. As the nebula cooled, the condensation sequence progressed to include other calcium-aluminum-rich minerals such as **melilite (Ca₂MgSi₂O₇)** and **anorthite (CaAl₂Si₂O₈)**. These minerals are critical components of calcium-aluminum-rich inclusions (CAIs), which are considered the oldest solids in the solar system.

- **Sulfur Chemistry**:  
  Sulfur primarily existed as **hydrogen sulfide (H₂S)** in the inner nebula, where it was stable at high temperatures. As the nebula cooled and moved outward, beyond the snow line (~3 AU), water vapor was depleted, and sulfur species shifted toward **calcium sulfide (CaS)** and **magnesium sulfide (MgS)**. This transition in sulfur chemistry altered the availability of Ca and Al for condensation, potentially influencing the formation of sulfide minerals and the overall mineralogy of CAIs.

### Condensation Sequence

1. **Initial Phases**:
   - **Hibonite (CaAl₁₂O₁₉)**: At the highest temperatures (~1600 K), hibonite is the first major calcium-aluminum-rich mineral to condense. Its formation is indicative of the extreme conditions in the inner nebula.
   - **Grossite (CaAl₂SiO₄)**: As temperatures drop below ~1400 K, grossite begins to form. This mineral is a key component in the early stages of CAI formation.
   - **Melilite (Ca₂MgSi₂O₇)**: At slightly lower temperatures (~1300 K), melilite condenses, contributing to the complex mineralogy of CAIs.
   - **Anorthite (CaAl₂Si₂O₈)**: Further cooling to ~1300 K allows for the formation of anorthite and other feldspathic phases, which are also common in CAIs.

2. **Influence of Sulfur Chemistry**:
   - **Sulfur-Rich Presolar Grains**: The incorporation of sulfur-rich presolar grains into the nebula could release sulfur into the gas phase or form sulfides like **CaS** and **FeS**. These sulfides sequester Ca and Al, reducing their availability for oxide and silicate formation. This shift in available elements can alter the condensation sequence, favoring the formation of sulfide minerals over oxides and silicates.
   - **Oxygen Fugacity**: The presence of sulfur-bearing phases like troilite and CaS can lower the oxygen fugacity (fO₂) locally. This change in fO₂ can alter the oxidation states of elements such as titanium (Ti), shifting from Ti⁴⁺ to Ti³⁺. Such changes in oxidation states can significantly affect the stability and formation of minerals, further influencing the condensation sequence.

### Isotopic Considerations

- **Heterogeneous Gas Composition**:  
  The nebula’s gas was initially heterogeneous, with oxygen isotopic variations driven by UV self-shielding effects. Similarly, sulfur isotopes from presolar grains may have created spatial or temporal gradients. These isotopic variations are critical for understanding the early solar system’s chemical and isotopic diversity.
- **Complex Textures in CAIs**:  
  CAIs exhibit complex textures, including relict phases and diffusion rims, which suggest they experienced multiple thermal events. These textures indicate that CAIs formed in an evolving environment, possibly due to radial mixing or exposure to different gas reservoirs influenced by sulfur-rich grains. The isotopic zoning observed in CAIs, such as variations in oxygen, calcium, and titanium isotopes, further supports the idea of a heterogeneous nebula.

### Challenges to Existing Models

- **Thermodynamic Uncertainties**:  
  Thermodynamic uncertainties persist regarding multicomponent solid solutions, such as pyroxenes in CAIs. These uncertainties complicate precise predictions of condensation pathways and the formation of complex mineral assemblages.
- **Role of Sulfur**:  
  The role of sulfur in modifying refractory element condensation requires further study. Current models often underrepresent the behavior of sulfur, particularly its competition with oxides to form sulfides. Understanding these interactions is crucial for accurately modeling the condensation sequences and the formation of CAIs.

### Relevance to CAIs

CAIs are interpreted as the oldest condensates in the solar system, but their textures and isotopic zoning suggest they formed in an evolving environment. Sulfur-rich presolar grains, if incorporated early, could have introduced nucleosynthetic anomalies into the gas or solid phases, leaving detectable imprints in CAI mineralogies. These imprints provide valuable insights into the early solar nebula’s conditions and the processes that shaped the formation of the solar system’s earliest solids.

In summary, the early solar nebula was a dynamic and heterogeneous environment where the condensation of refractory elements like calcium and aluminum was influenced by the presence of sulfur-rich presolar grains. These grains, through their isotopic signatures and mineralogical properties, played a critical role in shaping the chemical and isotopic diversity observed in CAIs. Understanding these processes is essential for unraveling the early solar system’s history and the formation of its earliest materials.

## Role of Sulfur in Early Condensation Processes

Sulfur’s behavior in the early solar nebula critically influenced the condensation of refractory elements such as calcium and aluminum. The interplay between sulfur-bearing phases and high-temperature mineral formation can be summarized as follows:

### 1. Sulfur Species and Phase Stability

- **Gaseous H₂S and Condensation Temperatures**:  
  At temperatures above ~1300 K, sulfur primarily exists as **gaseous H₂S**. However, the abundance of H₂S decreases inward of the snow line, where water vapor is more prevalent. Beyond the snow line (~3 AU), the depletion of water vapor allows sulfur to form species like **CaS**, **MgS**, and **SiS**, which have lower condensation temperatures. These sulfides can compete with oxides and silicates for refractory elements, altering the mineralogical sequence. For example, the formation of CaS might reduce the availability of Ca for condensing into hibonite or grossite, leading to a different distribution of calcium-rich minerals in CAIs.

- **Sulfur-Rich Presolar Grains**:  
  The presence of sulfur-rich presolar grains, such as those derived from supernovae (SN) and born-again asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars, introduces solid-phase sulfur into the nebula. These grains can act as seeds for sulfide mineral formation, further influencing the condensation of refractory elements. For instance, SN-derived SiC grains with embedded CaS subgrains can directly contribute to the formation of CaS, which might sequester calcium and alter the availability of Ca for other mineral phases.

### 2. Oxidation State Modulation

- **Local Oxygen Fugacity (fO₂)**:  
  Sulfur-rich phases can modulate the nebula’s **oxygen fugacity (fO₂)** locally. The formation of sulfides, such as FeS, reduces the oxygen fugacity, which can promote the stabilization of Ti³⁺ in spinel phases. This is a characteristic feature observed in some CAIs, indicating that sulfur-rich grains played a role in creating microenvironments with lower oxygen fugacity. Conversely, regions with higher oxygen fugacity, due to the presence of water-rich gas, would favor the formation of oxides, leading to compositional variability in CAIs.

- **Impact on Mineral Stability**:  
  The reduction of oxygen fugacity due to sulfide formation can also affect the stability of other minerals. For example, lower oxygen fugacity can stabilize Ti³⁺ in spinel, while higher oxygen fugacity promotes the formation of Ti⁴⁺ in other phases. This modulation of oxidation states can create distinct mineral assemblages in CAIs, reflecting the local conditions influenced by sulfur-rich grains.

### 3. Isotopic Fractionation

- **Presolar Isotopic Signatures**:  
  Sulfur-rich presolar grains carry unique isotopic signatures, such as <sup>³²</sup>S excess from the decay of <sup>³²</sup>Si. Upon incorporation into the nebula, these isotopes can mix with the ambient gas, altering the sulfur isotopic composition of condensing refractory phases. For instance, if a CAI formed in proximity to a cluster of sulfur-rich SN grains, its sulfide phases (e.g., CaS) might record the presolar <sup>³²</sup>S excess, while the surrounding oxide/silicate minerals could inherit a blend of solar and presolar isotopes.

- **Isotopic Heterogeneity in CAIs**:  
  The isotopic heterogeneity observed in CAIs, particularly in sulfur isotopes, can be attributed to the presence of sulfur-rich presolar grains. These grains introduce nucleosynthetic anomalies that are preserved in the CAIs, contributing to the observed isotopic variations. The coexistence of sulfides and refractory oxides in CAIs suggests that sulfur competed with oxygen for bonding with Ca and Al, leading to complex isotopic patterns.

### 4. Radiogenic Heating Effects

- **Short-Lived Radionuclides**:  
  Sulfur-rich grains, particularly those hosting short-lived radionuclides like <sup>⁶⁰</sup>Fe (from SN II) or <sup>²⁶</sup>Al (from AGB stars), could release heat via radioactive decay. This localized heating might prolong the survival of refractory elements in the gas phase or induce reheating events, resetting isotopic systems and contributing to the complex thermal histories of CAIs. The heat released from these radionuclides could also influence the condensation sequences by maintaining higher temperatures in specific regions of the nebula.

- **Thermal History of CAIs**:  
  The thermal history of CAIs, as inferred from their mineralogical and isotopic characteristics, suggests multiple heating and cooling events. The presence of short-lived radionuclides in sulfur-rich grains could explain these thermal fluctuations, as the heat released during decay could reheat the CAIs and reset isotopic systems. This process could lead to the formation of fine-grained rims and other textural features observed in CAIs.

### 5. Evidence from CAIs

- **Mineralogical Composition**:  
  CAIs in the Allende meteorite often contain **troilite (FeS)** and metallic iron phases alongside Al-rich minerals like melilite and spinel. The coexistence of sulfides and refractory oxides suggests overlapping condensation zones where sulfur competed with oxygen for bonding with Ca and Al. This competition can lead to the formation of distinct mineral assemblages, reflecting the local conditions influenced by sulfur-rich grains.

- **Fine-Grained Rims**:  
  Fine-grained rims on CAIs, enriched in sulfur and other volatiles, may represent later accretion of nebular dust, including presolar grains. These rims introduce additional compositional complexity, as they can incorporate sulfur-rich grains and other volatiles, further modulating the isotopic and mineralogical characteristics of the CAIs. The presence of these rims suggests that CAIs formed in a dynamic environment where the composition of the nebula was continuously evolving.

### 6. Model Limitations

- **Current Condensation Models**:  
  Current condensation models typically assume a sulfur-free environment for refractory element condensation, but this oversimplification ignores the potential impact of sulfur-rich presolar grains. Incorporating sulfur’s role requires revisiting phase equilibria and gas-solid partitioning coefficients. The presence of sulfur-rich grains can significantly alter the condensation sequences and the resulting mineral assemblages, necessitating a more comprehensive approach to modeling early solar nebula processes.

- **Spatial Distribution of Sulfur-Rich Grains**:  
  The spatial distribution of sulfur-rich grains (e.g., concentrated in certain regions of the nebula) could create microenvironments where CAIs formed with distinct isotopic ratios. This spatial variability can explain the observed heterogeneity in CAIs, as different regions of the nebula may have experienced different thermal and chemical conditions due to the presence of sulfur-rich grains. Understanding the distribution and impact of these grains is crucial for accurately modeling the early solar nebula and the formation of CAIs.

In summary, sulfur’s dual role as a gas-phase component and a carrier of presolar isotopes likely shaped both the mineralogical pathways and isotopic variability of early solar system condensates like CAIs. The interplay between sulfur-rich presolar grains and the condensation of refractory elements highlights the complexity of the early solar nebula and the importance of considering multiple factors in understanding the formation of primitive solar system materials.

## Isotopic Heterogeneities in Allende CAIs and Sulfur-Related Signatures

Allende’s calcium-aluminum-rich inclusions (CAIs) exhibit pronounced isotopic heterogeneities in multiple elements, including oxygen, titanium, and calcium. While sulfur isotopic anomalies are less emphasized in CAIs compared to other phases like chondrules, emerging studies hint at sulfur’s role in these variations.

### 1. Oxygen Isotopic Diversity

The Δ<sup>17</sup>O variations in Allende CAIs are widely attributed to **UV CO self-shielding**, a process that creates distinct gas reservoirs in the solar nebula. This mechanism explains the observed range of oxygen isotopic signatures, with some CAIs being <sup>16</sup>O-rich and others <sup>17</sup>,<sup>18</sup>O-enriched. However, presolar grains, including sulfur-rich varieties, may have contributed additional oxygen anomalies. These grains, carrying unique isotopic signatures from their stellar origins, could have mixed with the nebular gas, introducing further heterogeneity. For instance, the presence of sulfur-rich presolar grains in the nebula might have influenced the local oxygen fugacity, affecting the isotopic composition of condensing minerals.

### 2. Calcium Isotopic Anomalies

Many Allende CAIs display **elevated ε<sup>48</sup>Ca values** compared to non-carbonaceous chondrites. This deviation from the solar composition suggests the incorporation of presolar grains carrying <sup>44</sup>Ca excesses (e.g., from born-again AGB stars) or <sup>48</sup>Ca anomalies from Type II supernovae (SN II). For example, a fine-grained CAI like Curious Marie shows **Group II rare earth element (REE) patterns** and elevated <sup>48</sup>Ca, indicating condensation from a gas depleted in ultrarefractory components. The presence of sulfur-rich subgrains in its matrix could have influenced this depletion by sequestering Ca into sulfides, thereby altering the available Ca for oxide and silicate formation.

### 3. Titanium and Chromium Isotopes

Large <sup>50</sup>Ti excesses in Allende CAIs are correlated with sulfur-rich presolar grains from SN II, where neutron-rich zones produced these isotopes. For instance, the C-type SiC grain’s <sup>32</sup>S and <sup>50</sup>Ti anomalies suggest that SN II ejecta contributed both sulfur and titanium heterogeneities. The co-occurrence of these isotopic anomalies in CAIs indicates that SN II grains played a significant role in shaping the isotopic composition of early solar system materials. The presence of <sup>50</sup>Ti in CAIs, along with <sup>32</sup>S, highlights the complex interplay between different presolar grain types and their contributions to the nebula.

### 4. Sulfur Isotopic Signatures in CAIs

While direct measurements of sulfur isotopes in CAIs are sparse, secondary phases like sodalite and wadalite in Allende CAIs exhibit **<sup>32</sup>S excesses** due to the decay of <sup>32</sup>Si in presolar grains. The <sup>32</sup>Si is a short-lived radioactive isotope produced in SN II events, and its decay into <sup>32</sup>S introduces a distinct sulfur isotopic component into the solar nebula. Additionally, the <sup>36</sup>S excesses in secondary phases are linked to the decay of <sup>36</sup>Cl, but presolar sulfur contributions (e.g., from born-again AGB grains) could amplify or complicate these signatures. The presence of these isotopic anomalies in CAIs suggests that sulfur-rich presolar grains were incorporated into the early solar nebula, contributing to the observed isotopic heterogeneity.

### 5. Spatial and Temporal Variability

The distribution of sulfur-rich grains in the nebula may have created spatially distinct condensation zones. For example, regions closer to SN remnants or born-again AGB stars could exhibit higher <sup>32</sup>S and <sup>50</sup>Ti in CAIs. This spatial variability reflects the heterogeneous nature of the early solar nebula, where different regions were influenced by the presence of presolar grains with distinct isotopic compositions. Temporal variations, such as delayed mixing of stellar ejecta, might explain the persistence of isotopic heterogeneities in CAIs even after extensive nebular processing. The dynamic interplay between these spatial and temporal factors contributed to the complex isotopic signatures observed in Allende CAIs.

### 6. Case Study: Curious Marie CAI

The Curious Marie CAI is notable for its **ultrafine-grained texture** and **depletion in uranium**, suggesting rapid cooling or formation in a low-radiation environment. Its matrix contains sulfur-rich phases that may have scavenged Ca and Al, contributing to its unique isotopic profile. The <sup>36</sup>S excesses in its secondary minerals highlight the interplay between presolar sulfur isotopes (from <sup>32</sup>Si decay) and radiogenic contributions (from <sup>36</sup>Cl decay). This CAI’s isotopic and mineralogical characteristics provide a detailed example of how sulfur-rich presolar grains can influence the formation and isotopic composition of early solar system materials.

### 7. Implications for Mixing Models

The observed isotopic heterogeneity in Allende CAIs challenges the notion of a fully mixed nebula. Instead, it supports **partial mixing** scenarios where presolar grains retained their signatures, and CAIs formed in localized reservoirs with distinct compositions. Sulfur-rich grains, by delivering isotopically anomalous sulfur and other elements, could have amplified these reservoir differences, leaving detectable traces in CAI mineralogies. This partial mixing model explains the coexistence of isotopically diverse CAIs within the same meteorite, reflecting the complex and dynamic nature of the early solar nebula.

### Future Directions

Future investigations must directly measure sulfur isotopes in CAI sulfides and presolar grain inclusions to clarify their contribution to isotopic diversity. High-resolution isotopic and mineralogical analyses, combined with detailed modeling of nebular processes, will provide a more comprehensive understanding of the role of sulfur-rich presolar grains in shaping the early solar system. These studies will help refine our models of CAI formation and the isotopic evolution of the solar nebula.

By integrating these insights, we can better understand the interplay between presolar grains and the early solar nebula, shedding light on the origins and evolution of the solar system.

## Models Explaining the Influence of Sulfur-Rich Presolar Grains on CAI Isotopes

### 1. Nucleosynthetic Input from Multiple Stellar Sources

#### Supernova II (SN II) Model
The **Supernova II (SN II) model** posits that sulfur-rich silicon carbide (SiC) grains, particularly those of the C-type, deliver significant <sup>³²</sup>S excesses via the decay of <sup>³²</sup>Si. These grains, formed in the explosive outer layers of massive stars, carry unique isotopic signatures that can be traced back to their stellar origins. When incorporated into the early solar nebula, these grains can introduce localized <sup>³²</sup>S anomalies into the gas or solid phases. If these grains were present in the precursors of calcium-aluminum-rich inclusions (CAIs), their sulfur isotopes could fractionate into the condensing phases, leading to distinct <sup>³²</sup>S anomalies in CAIs. This model helps explain the observed sulfur isotopic variations in CAIs, particularly in secondary phases like sodalite and wadalite, which show <sup>³²</sup>S excesses.

#### Born-Again Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) Grains
**Born-again AGB grains** from stars undergoing Very Late Thermal Pulses (VLTPs) also contribute to the isotopic diversity in CAIs. These grains are characterized by low <sup>¹²</sup>C/<sup>¹³</sup>C ratios and significant <sup>³²</sup>S excesses, as well as <sup>⁴⁴</sup>Ca anomalies. The <sup>³²</sup>S excesses in these grains arise from the decay of <sup>³²</sup>Si, while the <sup>⁴⁴</sup>Ca anomalies are linked to the s-process nucleosynthesis in AGB stars. When these grains are incorporated into the early solar nebula, they can introduce these isotopic signatures into CAIs, contributing to the observed calcium isotopic variations. For example, CAIs with elevated <sup>⁴⁸</sup>Ca values might have formed in regions enriched with born-again AGB grains, leading to the preservation of these isotopic anomalies.

### 2. Sulfur-Induced Phase Competition

Sulfur-rich presolar grains can significantly influence the chemical equilibrium in the early solar nebula by introducing excess sulfur. This can shift the condensation sequences of refractory elements like calcium (Ca) and aluminum (Al). For instance, the presence of sulfur-rich grains can promote the formation of **CaS** and **MgS** sulfides, which compete with oxides and silicates for these elements. This competition can reduce the availability of Ca and Al for the formation of minerals like hibonite and grossite, leading to mineralogical differences in CAIs. CAIs forming in sulfur-rich zones might display fewer hibonite grains and more sulfide phases, reflecting the influence of presolar grain input. The resulting isotopic anomalies in these CAIs can provide insights into the local chemical environment and the extent of sulfur's impact on condensation processes.

### 3. Radionuclide Heating Effects

Short-lived radionuclides like <sup>⁶⁰</sup>Fe and <sup>²⁶</sup>Al, which are often associated with sulfur-rich presolar grains, can release heat via radioactive decay. This localized heating can delay the cooling of CAI-forming regions, altering the condensation sequences and enabling prolonged gas-solid interactions. For example, <sup>⁶⁰</sup>Fe, which decays into <sup>⁶⁰</sup>Ni with a half-life of 1.5 million years, can be found in sulfide phases like troilite (FeS). The heat released from <sup>⁶⁰</sup>Fe decay can maintain higher temperatures in the CAI-forming regions, allowing for the continued condensation of refractory elements and the formation of complex mineral assemblages. Similarly, <sup>²⁶</sup>Al, with a half-life of 0.7 million years, can be found in grains from AGB stars and can contribute to the thermal budget of the nebula, influencing the condensation of CAIs.

### 4. Preservation of Stellar Signatures

The survival of sulfur-rich presolar grains in CAIs is crucial for preserving their isotopic anomalies. These grains, if incorporated into CAIs, can retain their unique isotopic signatures, even if the bulk nebula later became more homogeneous. For instance, a CAI with a high concentration of SN-derived SiC grains might exhibit <sup>⁵⁰</sup>Ti excesses and <sup>³²</sup>S anomalies, reflecting the nucleosynthetic processes in the parent stars. The presence of embedded CaS subgrains in CAIs can also preserve the isotopic signatures of these grains, providing a record of the early solar nebula's chemical and isotopic diversity. The preservation of these signatures in CAIs can help trace the origins of the presolar grains and the conditions under which CAIs formed.

### 5. Galactic Chemical Enrichment

The solar system formed in a molecular cloud already enriched with stardust from prior generations of stars. Sulfur-rich grains from SN II and born-again AGB stars contributed to this enrichment, introducing nucleosynthetic anomalies into the nebula’s dust reservoir. CAIs, as early condensates, would capture these variations if the grains were not fully mixed or processed. The presence of sulfur-rich grains in the early solar nebula can explain the observed isotopic heterogeneities in CAIs, particularly in elements like titanium and calcium. The enrichment of the nebula with these grains can also account for the spatial and temporal variability in CAI isotopic compositions, reflecting the dynamic and heterogeneous nature of the early solar system.

### 6. Limitations and Uncertainties

Despite the compelling evidence for the influence of sulfur-rich presolar grains on CAI isotopes, several limitations and uncertainties remain. Current models lack detailed phase diagrams accounting for sulfur-rich phases during high-temperature condensation. Without this, the extent of sulfur’s influence on Ca-Al mineral formation remains speculative. Additionally, the rarity of sulfur-rich presolar grains (e.g., <1% of SiC grains) means their impact on bulk CAI isotopes may be subtle, requiring high-precision analyses of individual grains or CAI components. The complexity of the early solar nebula and the potential for multiple overlapping processes (e.g., thermal and chemical fractionation) further complicate the interpretation of CAI isotopic data.

### Supporting Evidence

Studies using **NanoSIMS** and **TEM** have revealed that CAIs contain **relict phases** (e.g., melilite fragments) and fine-grained rims with isotopic anomalies, consistent with the integration of presolar grains during formation. The correlation between <sup>⁵⁰</sup>Ti and <sup>³²</sup>S in some CAIs suggests a shared nucleosynthetic origin, possibly from SN II ejecta. These findings support the models that propose the influence of sulfur-rich presolar grains on CAI isotopic heterogeneities and highlight the importance of high-precision analytical techniques in understanding the early solar system's chemical and isotopic diversity.

## Impact of Sulfur-Rich Grains on Thermal and Chemical Evolution of the Early Solar Nebula

### 1. Thermal Budget Modulation

Sulfur-rich presolar grains played a significant role in modulating the thermal budget of the early solar nebula. Grains containing short-lived radionuclides, such as <sup>⁶⁰</sup>Fe in sulfides, released heat as they decayed. This localized heating could have sustained higher temperatures in CAI-forming regions, delaying the onset of condensation or causing reheating events that reset isotopic systems. For instance, the decay of <sup>⁶⁰</sup>Fe, with a half-life of about 1.5 million years, would have provided a continuous heat source, potentially maintaining the high temperatures necessary for the formation of refractory minerals like hibonite and grossite.

Additionally, the energy released from the decay of <sup>³²</sup>Si (half-life ~172 years) in sulfur-rich grains, though negligible compared to long-lived radionuclides like <sup>²⁶</sup>Al (half-life ~0.7 million years), might have contributed to brief thermal spikes in regions densely populated by these grains. These thermal spikes could have induced localized reheating events, affecting the condensation sequences and isotopic compositions of nearby materials. The cumulative effect of these heating events would have created a dynamic thermal environment, influencing the formation and evolution of CAIs.

### 2. Chemical Redistribution

Sulfur-rich grains acted as reservoirs for elements like calcium (Ca) and aluminum (Al). Their dissolution or fragmentation during nebula processing could have released these elements back into the gas phase, altering the local elemental ratios. This redistribution of elements would have had significant implications for the condensation of refractory minerals. For example, the formation of sulfides such as CaS sequestered Ca and Al, potentially redistributing them away from oxide/silicate condensation pathways. This could explain the observed variability in CAI mineralogies, such as differences in hibonite abundance.

The presence of CaS and other sulfides in CAIs suggests that sulfur-rich grains influenced the availability of Ca and Al for condensation. In regions where sulfur-rich grains were abundant, the formation of sulfides might have reduced the amount of Ca and Al available for oxide and silicate minerals, leading to a different mineralogical composition compared to regions with fewer sulfur-rich grains. This chemical redistribution would have created spatial and temporal variations in the composition of CAIs, contributing to their isotopic and mineralogical diversity.

### 3. Isotopic Mixing and Fractionation

Sulfur-rich grains introduced isotopically distinct components into the nebula’s dust-gas mixture. Their heterogeneous distribution created micro-reservoirs where CAIs formed with signatures from specific stellar sources. For example, regions dominated by born-again AGB grains would have Ca isotopes skewed toward <sup>⁴⁴</sup>Ca excesses, while SN-rich regions might exhibit <sup>⁵⁰</sup>Ti and <sup>³²</sup>S anomalies. These isotopic signatures would have been preserved in CAIs, contributing to the observed isotopic heterogeneities.

The isotopic mixing and fractionation processes driven by sulfur-rich grains would have created a complex isotopic landscape in the early solar nebula. The incorporation of presolar grains with distinct isotopic compositions into CAI-forming regions would have introduced nucleosynthetic anomalies, such as <sup>⁵⁰</sup>Ti and <sup>³²</sup>S excesses, which are not typically found in solar system materials. This isotopic diversity would have been further amplified by the localized thermal and chemical conditions in the nebula, leading to the formation of CAIs with unique isotopic signatures.

### 4. Oxygen Fugacity Effects

Sulfur-rich phases, such as FeS, can significantly reduce local oxygen fugacity (fO₂), favoring the formation of metallic iron and Ti³⁺-bearing spinels in CAIs. This aligns with the observation that some CAIs contain both sulfides and spinel phases. The reduction in fO₂ due to the presence of sulfur-rich grains would have shifted the chemical equilibrium, promoting the formation of metallic iron and Ti³⁺-bearing minerals over oxides and silicates.

Conversely, sulfur-poor regions with higher fO₂ would have promoted oxide formation, contributing to the diversity of CAI textures. The spatial and temporal variations in fO₂, driven by the distribution of sulfur-rich grains, would have created distinct chemical environments where CAIs formed with different mineralogical compositions. This variability in fO₂ would have influenced the condensation sequences and isotopic compositions of CAIs, leading to the observed heterogeneities in their mineralogies.

### 5. Survival and Protection Mechanisms

The small size (<0.5–1 µm) of sulfur-rich grains facilitated their rapid settling into the nebula’s midplane, where CAIs are thought to form. Their resistance to evaporation ensured that their isotopic signatures were preserved, even during high-temperature events. The small size and high surface area of these grains allowed them to efficiently capture and retain isotopic anomalies, which were then incorporated into CAIs during condensation.

Aggregates of presolar grains, such as those found in chondritic matrices, may have shielded sulfur-rich grains from destructive processes, allowing their incorporation into CAIs. These aggregates acted as protective environments, preserving the isotopic and chemical signatures of the grains. The survival of sulfur-rich grains in CAIs is evidenced by the presence of relict phases and fine-grained rims with isotopic anomalies, consistent with the integration of presolar grains during formation.

### 6. Parent-Body Processing

Post-formation processes on meteorite parent bodies, such as thermal metamorphism or aqueous alteration, could have redistributed sulfur isotopes. For instance, water-rock interactions might dissolve sulfur-rich phases, leaving behind secondary minerals that retain radiogenic <sup>³⁶</sup>S from <sup>³⁶</sup>Cl decay. These secondary processes would have further modified the isotopic and chemical compositions of CAIs, adding another layer of complexity to their formation history.

Thermal metamorphism on parent bodies could have altered the mineralogical and isotopic compositions of CAIs by inducing recrystallization and isotopic fractionation. Aqueous alteration, on the other hand, might have dissolved sulfur-rich phases, leading to the formation of secondary minerals with distinct isotopic signatures. These processes would have influenced the final isotopic and mineralogical characteristics of CAIs, contributing to the observed heterogeneities in meteoritic samples.

### 7. Galactic Context

The influx of sulfur-rich grains reflects the solar system’s formation in a star-forming region heavily polluted by supernova (SN) and asymptotic giant branch (AGB) ejecta. This galactic-scale chemical inheritance underscores the importance of presolar materials in seeding the nebula’s compositional diversity. The solar system formed in a molecular cloud already enriched with stardust from prior generations of stars, and sulfur-rich grains from SN and AGB stars contributed to this enrichment.

The presence of sulfur-rich grains in the early solar nebula is a direct result of the galactic chemical evolution, where multiple stellar sources contributed to the dust and gas reservoir. The heterogeneous distribution of these grains created micro-reservoirs with distinct isotopic and chemical compositions, which were then incorporated into CAIs during their formation. This galactic context highlights the interconnectedness of stellar nucleosynthesis and the early solar system, emphasizing the role of presolar materials in shaping the isotopic and mineralogical diversity of CAIs.

### Summary

These effects collectively highlight sulfur-rich presolar grains as agents of both thermal perturbation and compositional heterogeneity, directly impacting the formation and isotopic character of CAIs in the Allende meteorite. The thermal budget modulation, chemical redistribution, isotopic mixing, oxygen fugacity effects, survival mechanisms, and galactic context all contribute to the complex and dynamic environment of the early solar nebula. Understanding these processes is crucial for unraveling the early history of the solar system and the formation of its oldest solids.

## Conclusion and Implications

The incorporation of sulfur-rich presolar grains into the early solar nebula likely played a pivotal role in shaping the condensation of refractory elements like calcium and aluminum, as well as the isotopic heterogeneities observed in CAIs from the Allende meteorite. Key conclusions include:

### Presolar Grain Origins
Sulfur-rich grains, such as Type AB SiC from born-again AGB stars and SN II-derived grains with <sup>³²</sup>S excesses, introduced nucleosynthetic anomalies into the nebula. These grains acted as isotopic "fingerprints," contributing to the diversity of CAIs. Born-again AGB stars, experiencing late-stage helium shell flashes, produce grains with low <sup>¹²</sup>C/<sup>¹³</sup>C ratios and significant <sup>³²</sup>S excesses. SN II ejecta, on the other hand, generate grains with <sup>³²</sup>S excesses from the decay of <sup>³²</sup>Si, a short-lived radioactive isotope. The distinct isotopic signatures of these grains are preserved in CAIs, reflecting their stellar origins and the heterogeneous nature of the early solar nebula.

### Condensation Dynamics
Sulfur chemistry altered mineral formation pathways by promoting sulfide phases (e.g., CaS, FeS), which competed with oxides and silicates for Ca and Al. This phase competition could explain variations in CAI mineralogy, such as the prevalence of melilite over hibonite in certain inclusions. The presence of sulfur-rich grains in the nebula shifted the chemical equilibrium, favoring the formation of sulfides over oxides. For example, regions with higher sulfur content might have seen more CaS formation, reducing the availability of Ca for hibonite and grossite. This dynamic interplay between sulfur and refractory elements is crucial for understanding the mineralogical diversity observed in CAIs.

### Isotopic Heterogeneity Drivers
The distinct sulfur isotopic signatures (e.g., <sup>³²</sup>S from <sup>³²</sup>Si decay) and multi-element anomalies (e.g., <sup>⁵⁰</sup>Ti) in sulfur-rich grains are preserved in CAIs. This supports the idea that CAIs formed in spatially or temporally distinct nebular regions where these grains were concentrated. The isotopic anomalies in CAIs, such as elevated <sup>⁴⁸</sup>Ca and <sup>⁵⁰</sup>Ti, can be attributed to the incorporation of sulfur-rich grains from SN II and born-again AGB stars. These grains introduced nucleosynthetic signatures that were preserved during CAI formation, contributing to the observed isotopic heterogeneities.

### Thermal Evolution Contributions
Radionuclides hosted in sulfur-rich grains (e.g., <sup>⁶⁰</sup>Fe) released heat, potentially delaying condensation or inducing reheating events. Such thermal fluctuations could explain CAIs’ complex textures and isotopic zoning. The decay of short-lived radionuclides like <sup>⁶⁰</sup>Fe and <sup>²⁶</sup>Al provided localized heating, which could have sustained higher temperatures in CAI-forming regions. This prolonged the gas-solid interactions, allowing for the formation of complex mineral assemblages and isotopic zoning. The thermal effects of these radionuclides are critical for understanding the thermal history and evolution of CAIs.

### Broader Implications
The isotopic diversity in Allende CAIs challenges the assumption of a fully mixed early solar nebula. Instead, it suggests that **local reservoirs** of stardust and gas existed, with sulfur-rich grains serving as markers of these reservoirs. The presence of these grains indicates that the early solar nebula was chemically and isotopically heterogeneous, with distinct regions influenced by different stellar sources. Understanding these processes provides insights into the **mixing efficiency** of stellar materials in the nebula and the timescales of early solar system evolution. The heterogeneity observed in CAIs reflects the complex interplay between stellar nucleosynthesis, nebular dynamics, and thermal processing.

### Future Research Directions
Future research should prioritize **direct analysis of sulfur isotopes** in CAI sulfides and embedded presolar grains. High-resolution imaging and isotopic mapping of CAIs could identify sulfur-rich grain inclusions and trace their contribution to CAI heterogeneity. Techniques such as NanoSIMS and TEM are essential for characterizing the mineralogy and isotopic compositions of these grains. Additionally, refining thermodynamic models to incorporate sulfur-rich phases will better predict how these grains influenced condensation pathways. This work will provide a more comprehensive understanding of the early solar nebula and the role of presolar grains in shaping the chemical and isotopic architecture of the solar system.

**Unresolved Questions and Future Research Priorities:**
- **Direct Sulfur Isotope Measurements**: There is a critical need for direct measurements of sulfur isotopes in CAI sulfides and presolar grain inclusions. These measurements will help clarify the extent to which sulfur-rich grains contributed to the isotopic diversity observed in CAIs.
- **Improved Thermodynamic Models**: Current thermodynamic models often underrepresent the behavior of sulfur-rich phases. Developing more comprehensive models that incorporate sulfur-rich phases will enhance our understanding of the condensation sequences and the formation of CAIs.
- **Spatial and Temporal Variability**: Further research is needed to understand the spatial and temporal distribution of sulfur-rich grains in the early solar nebula. This will help explain the observed heterogeneities in CAIs and the processes that shaped the early solar system.

Ultimately, this research reinforces the view that presolar grains were integral to the formation of CAIs and played a significant role in shaping the early solar system's chemical and isotopic diversity.
