Question: What are the specific ontogenetic shifts in the diet and feeding behavior of juvenile Lake Sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens) in response to invasive Zebra Mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) colonization of their native spawning habitats in the Great Lakes, and how can these changes inform adaptive management strategies for conserving this endangered species?

# Ontogenetic Shifts in Diet and Feeding Behavior of Juvenile Lake Sturgeon in Response to Zebra Mussel Colonization: Implications for Conservation Strategies

## Introduction

Lake Sturgeon (*Acipenser fulvescens*) is an ancient, slow-growing species native to the Great Lakes, listed as endangered in many regions due to habitat loss, overfishing, and invasive species. This species is characterized by its long lifespan, delayed sexual maturity, and low reproductive rates, making it particularly vulnerable to environmental changes and anthropogenic pressures. Ontogenetic shifts in their diet are critical for survival, transitioning from invertebrate-based diets in early life stages to include larger prey like bivalves and fish as they mature. Understanding these dietary transitions is essential for effective conservation and management strategies.

The invasive Zebra Mussel (*Dreissena polymorpha*) has drastically altered Great Lakes ecosystems, colonizing benthic habitats and displacing native species. Zebra Mussels are highly efficient filter feeders, capable of significantly reducing phytoplankton and zooplankton populations, which in turn affects the availability of prey for juvenile Lake Sturgeon. These mussels also form dense colonies on hard substrates, altering habitat structure and reducing the availability of preferred foraging grounds. The colonization of spawning and feeding habitats by Zebra Mussels poses a significant threat to the survival and growth of juvenile Lake Sturgeon, as it can disrupt their access to critical food resources.

This study examines how juvenile Lake Sturgeon adjust their feeding behaviors and diets in response to Zebra Mussel colonization of their native spawning grounds. By synthesizing recent research on dietary adaptations, habitat preferences, and invasive species interactions, we aim to highlight opportunities for mitigating threats to this imperiled species. Specifically, we explore the direct and indirect impacts of Zebra Mussel colonization on juvenile Lake Sturgeon, including changes in foraging success, prey availability, and habitat use. Additionally, we consider the role of other invasive species, such as the Round Goby (*Neogobius melanostomus*), which has emerged as a significant prey item for Lake Sturgeon in invaded areas.

The findings from this study have important implications for the conservation and management of Lake Sturgeon populations. By understanding how juveniles adapt to the presence of invasive species, we can develop targeted strategies to protect and restore their habitats, ensuring the long-term survival of this iconic species. This research underscores the complex interactions within invaded ecosystems and the need for adaptive management approaches that account for the dynamic nature of these environments.

## Natural Diet and Ontogenetic Shifts in Lake Sturgeon

Lake Sturgeon (*Acipenser fulvescens*) exhibit pronounced ontogenetic shifts in diet as they grow, reflecting changes in mouth morphology and foraging capabilities. These shifts are crucial for their survival and growth, as they transition from consuming small, soft-bodied invertebrates to larger, harder-shelled prey. Understanding these dietary changes is essential for developing effective conservation strategies, especially in the context of invasive species like the Zebra Mussel (*Dreissena polymorpha*).

### Juvenile Diet and Foraging Behavior

Juvenile Lake Sturgeon, typically measuring less than 600–900 mm in length, primarily rely on small, soft-bodied invertebrates such as chironomid larvae, mayfly nymphs, and annelids. These prey items are abundant in sand or gravel substrates, which provide optimal conditions for foraging. Juveniles use tactile feeding methods, as they lack vision and rely on electroreceptors and barbels to locate and capture prey. The sand and gravel habitats are crucial for juvenile sturgeon because they offer a stable environment with a rich supply of invertebrates. For example, in the North Channel of the St. Clair River, juvenile sturgeon exhibit a high degree of site fidelity to these deeper, sand/gravel habitats, where they can efficiently forage for their preferred prey.

### Transition to Larger Prey

As Lake Sturgeon mature beyond approximately 600–900 mm, their diets undergo significant changes. The transition to larger prey is driven by the development of a larger mouth gape, which allows them to consume harder-shelled organisms such as crayfish, snails, and bivalves. This ontogenetic shift is a critical adaptation that enables sturgeon to exploit a wider range of food resources. In the St. Lawrence Estuarine Transition Zone, for instance, lake sturgeon over 600 mm routinely prey on mollusks, while these are nearly absent in the diets of smaller individuals. Similarly, in Oneida Lake, Zebra Mussels are the most frequent food source for sturgeon larger than 900 mm, highlighting the importance of bivalves in the diets of adult sturgeon.

### Impacts of Zebra Mussel Colonization on Diet and Ontogenetic Shifts

The invasion of Zebra Mussels has significantly altered the benthic habitats of the Great Lakes, posing challenges for juvenile Lake Sturgeon. Zebra Mussels colonize and coat sandy/silty substrates with their shells, reducing the availability of epifaunal invertebrates that juvenile sturgeon rely on. Laboratory experiments have shown that even 50% zebra mussel cover can significantly reduce foraging success on chironomids, amphipods, and isopods. Juveniles may avoid zebra mussel colonies altogether, leading to a reduction in their foraging efficiency and forcing them to seek alternative foraging areas. This habitat avoidance can result in premature ontogenetic shifts in diet, as juveniles may need to consume smaller or less-preferred prey to compensate for reduced foraging success in their native habitats.

#### Forcing Habitat Avoidance

Zebra Mussels colonize and coat substrates with their shells, creating complex, shell-covered surfaces that juvenile Lake Sturgeon actively avoid. Laboratory experiments have shown that even 50% zebra mussel coverage on the substrate significantly reduces foraging success, and 95% coverage virtually eliminates it. Juveniles exhibit strong avoidance behavior, abandoning traditional foraging grounds where their preferred prey, such as chironomids and amphipods, are now inaccessible. This habitat avoidance forces juveniles to seek alternative foraging areas, which may be suboptimal and less productive, potentially leading to reduced growth and survival rates.

#### Reducing Prey Availability

Zebra Mussels are highly efficient filter feeders, capable of filtering up to one gallon of water per day per mussel. This activity drastically reduces phytoplankton and zooplankton populations, which are critical for the survival of larval and juvenile fish and invertebrates. The depletion of plankton has a cascading effect on the benthic community, leading to a decline in the populations of chironomids, mayflies, and other insect larvae that juvenile Lake Sturgeon rely on for nutrition. This reduction in prey availability further exacerbates the challenges faced by juveniles in invaded habitats, as they must find alternative food sources to meet their nutritional needs.

#### Accelerating Piscivory

In regions where Round Goby (*Neogobius melanostomus*) coexists with Zebra Mussels, juvenile Lake Sturgeon have adapted by incorporating Round Goby into their diets at smaller sizes than previously observed. Studies in the Niagara River and Lake Ontario have shown that Round Goby now constitutes up to 44% of the dietary biomass for Lake Sturgeon, enabling earlier piscivory at sizes around 700 mm. This shift to piscivory at smaller sizes is a significant ontogenetic adaptation that may improve growth rates due to the higher energy content of fish prey compared to invertebrates. However, this adaptation also raises concerns about the long-term ecological consequences of relying on an invasive species for sustenance.

#### Paradoxical Impact on Juveniles and Adults

While Zebra Mussels pose significant challenges to juvenile Lake Sturgeon, they also provide a new food source for larger juveniles and adults. As sturgeon grow beyond 600–900 mm, their mouth gape size increases, allowing them to consume larger prey, including Zebra Mussels. This dietary shift is observed in regions with high mussel densities, such as Oneida Lake, where Zebra Mussels dominate the diets of adult Lake Sturgeon. However, the nutritional value of Zebra Mussels is lower compared to native prey, and they are often described as "junk food" due to their low energy density. This paradoxical scenario highlights the complex interactions between invasive species and native predators, where the benefits to adults may come at a cost to juveniles.

#### Geographic and Habitat Context

The impact of Zebra Mussel colonization on Lake Sturgeon diets varies across different regions and habitats. In the St. Clair River’s North Channel, where Zebra Mussels are less abundant, juveniles maintain invertebrate-dominated diets, emphasizing the importance of substrate type and mussel density in driving dietary shifts. In contrast, in heavily invaded areas like the Niagara River, the presence of Round Goby and Zebra Mussels has led to significant changes in the feeding behavior and dietary composition of juvenile Lake Sturgeon. These regional differences underscore the need for habitat-specific management strategies to address the unique challenges posed by invasive species in different ecosystems.

### Role of Round Goby

The Round Goby (*Neogobius melanostomus*), another invasive species, has emerged as a significant component of Lake Sturgeon diets, particularly in areas where zebra mussels are prevalent. Round Goby preys on small zebra mussels and other benthic invertebrates, making it a high-quality prey item for juvenile sturgeon. In the Niagara River and Lake Ontario, Round Goby contributes up to 44% by mass to the diet of Lake Sturgeon, with stable isotope analysis confirming its importance as a long-term prey source. The availability of Round Goby allows juvenile sturgeon to shift to piscivory earlier and at smaller sizes, potentially improving their growth and survival. This dietary shift may offset some of the negative impacts of zebra mussel colonization by providing an alternative food source that is rich in nutrients.

### Broader Ecological Implications

The interaction between invasive species like Zebra Mussels and Round Goby has reshaped food webs in the Great Lakes, forcing native species like Lake Sturgeon to adapt their diets. While the presence of Round Goby may offer a "silver lining" by improving access to nutrient-rich fish prey earlier in life, the long-term impacts on population recovery remain uncertain. The shift in diet could enhance recruitment success for Lake Sturgeon, but it also requires further study to assess the broader ecological consequences of altered food web dynamics.

## Adaptive Management Strategies for Lake Sturgeon Conservation

To mitigate the impacts of Zebra Mussel colonization on juvenile Lake Sturgeon, adaptive management strategies must address habitat preservation, prey availability, and invasive species control. These strategies aim to protect critical habitats, enhance prey resources, and control the spread of invasive species while promoting the recovery and sustainability of Lake Sturgeon populations.

### 1. Protect Juvenile-Specific Habitats

#### Restoring and Safeguarding Sand/Gravel Substrates
Juvenile Lake Sturgeon rely on sand and gravel substrates in deep-water areas for foraging on invertebrates such as chironomids and annelids. These substrates are critical for their early life stages, providing the necessary conditions for locating and capturing prey. To protect these habitats:
- **Restoration Efforts**: Implement habitat restoration projects to restore degraded sand and gravel substrates. This can involve removing sediment buildup, reintroducing native substrate materials, and enhancing substrate complexity to support a diverse benthic community.
- **Preventing Colonization**: Use physical barriers such as screens or mats to prevent Zebra Mussel colonization in key juvenile habitats. Early detection programs can also help identify and manage mussel populations before they become established.

#### Ensuring Habitat Connectivity
Maintaining connectivity between juvenile and adult habitats is essential for facilitating ontogenetic transitions without excessive predation risk. Strategies include:
- **Habitat Linkages**: Create and maintain corridors that connect sandy/gravel habitats (juvenile) with rocky/bivalve-rich areas (adult). This can be achieved through the removal of barriers such as dams or the creation of fish passages.
- **Habitat Management**: Ensure that habitat management practices do not disrupt the natural flow and connectivity of water bodies, which can affect the distribution and availability of prey for juveniles.

### 2. Enhance Round Goby Monitoring

#### Assessing Round Goby Populations
Round Goby (*Neogobius melanostomus*) has emerged as a significant prey item for juvenile Lake Sturgeon in Zebra Mussel-affected areas. To leverage this resource:
- **Population Assessments**: Conduct regular surveys to monitor Round Goby populations in key sturgeon habitats. This can help identify areas where their abundance can support early piscivory in juveniles.
- **Controlled Proliferation**: Promote controlled Round Goby proliferation in regions where they do not threaten other native species. This can be achieved through habitat management practices that favor Round Goby while minimizing their impact on other species.

#### Monitoring Long-Term Effects
Understanding the long-term effects of Round Goby consumption on sturgeon health and growth is crucial:
- **Health Assessments**: Regularly assess the health and growth rates of juvenile sturgeon in areas with high Round Goby populations. This can help identify any unintended consequences of relying on an invasive prey base.
- **Ecological Impact Studies**: Conduct studies to evaluate the broader ecological impacts of Round Goby proliferation, including their effects on other native species and ecosystem dynamics.

### 3. Targeted Invasive Species Control

#### Deploying Biocontrol Agents
Species-specific biocontrol agents can be effective in managing Zebra Mussel populations in critical habitats:
- **Zequanox**: Deploy *Zequanox* (a bacterial treatment) in localized areas such as spawning grounds and nursery habitats. *Zequanox* can reduce mussel populations without harming native species.
- **Chemical Treatments**: Collaborate with the Invasive Mussel Collaborative (IMC) and regional agencies to standardize protocols for chemical treatments (e.g., chlorine) and infrastructure modifications (e.g., mussel-resistant coatings) to reduce colonization.

#### Infrastructure Modifications
Modifying infrastructure to prevent mussel colonization is essential:
- **Mussel-Resistant Coatings**: Apply mussel-resistant coatings to water intake structures, pipes, and other infrastructure to prevent mussel attachment and colonization.
- **Early Detection and Rapid Response**: Implement early detection and rapid response programs to identify and manage mussel populations before they become established in critical habitats.

### 4. Restocking Program Adjustments

#### Avoiding Zebra Mussel-Dense Waters
Releasing small juveniles into Zebra Mussel-dense waters can be detrimental to their survival:
- **Selecting Suitable Habitats**: Avoid releasing small juveniles (<600 mm) into areas with high Zebra Mussel densities. Instead, restock in areas with intact sand/gravel substrates or establish captive-rearing programs to boost survival rates.
- **Mussel-Free Tributaries**: Introduce juveniles into mussel-free tributaries or upstream habitats to minimize exposure during their vulnerable early stages.

### 5. Ecosystem-Level Management

#### Maintaining Water Quality
Regulating nutrient inputs is crucial for maintaining water quality and preventing excessive plankton blooms, which Zebra Mussels exploit:
- **Nutrient Management**: Implement nutrient management practices to reduce nutrient runoff into water bodies. This can help prevent excessive plankton blooms and reduce the food source for Zebra Mussels.
- **Monitoring Microcystis Blooms**: Monitor Microcystis blooms (induced by reduced plankton) and their toxicity to sturgeon. Implement measures to mitigate the impacts of these blooms on water quality and sturgeon health.

#### Restoring Native Unionid Clam Populations
Restoring native unionid clam populations can help compete with Zebra Mussels and stabilize benthic communities:
- **Reintroduction Programs**: Develop and implement programs to reintroduce native unionid clams into areas where they have been displaced by Zebra Mussels.
- **Habitat Enhancement**: Enhance habitat conditions to support the recovery of native clams, including improving water quality and substrate conditions.

### 6. Research and Monitoring

#### Long-Term Studies
Conducting long-term studies is essential for tracking the impacts of Zebra Mussel colonization on juvenile Lake Sturgeon:
- **Growth and Survival Rates**: Monitor juvenile growth rates, survival, and reproductive success in Zebra Mussel-impacted versus uninvaded systems. This can help identify the most effective management strategies.
- **Reproductive Success**: Evaluate the reproductive success of adult sturgeon in areas with high Zebra Mussel densities to understand the long-term impacts on population dynamics.

#### Feasibility of Reintroducing Native Prey
Assessing the feasibility of reintroducing native prey species can help enhance prey availability for juveniles:
- **Reintroduction Feasibility**: Evaluate the feasibility of reintroducing native prey species such as Diporeia or enhancing habitat complexity in ways that support juvenile foraging without favoring Zebra Mussels.
- **Habitat Complexity**: Enhance habitat complexity through the introduction of artificial structures or the restoration of natural habitat features to support a diverse benthic community.

### Challenges

- **Balancing Invasive Species Control**: Balancing the need to control Zebra Mussels while preserving Round Goby populations (which aid sturgeon but threaten other species) is a significant challenge.
- **Biocontrol Safety**: Ensuring that biocontrol methods do not inadvertently harm juvenile sturgeon or other endangered species is crucial.
- **Jurisdictional Coordination**: Coordinating across multiple jurisdictions (states/provinces) to enforce consistent prevention measures and habitat protection policies is essential for effective management.

By integrating these strategies, managers can mitigate immediate threats to juveniles while leveraging ecological changes (e.g., Round Goby availability) to support population recovery. This comprehensive approach is essential for the long-term conservation and sustainability of Lake Sturgeon populations in the face of Zebra Mussel colonization.

## Conclusion

The colonization of Zebra Mussels (*Dreissena polymorpha*) in the Great Lakes has fundamentally altered the diet and feeding behavior of Lake Sturgeon (*Acipenser fulvescens*), particularly among juveniles. While adults benefit nutritionally from consuming Zebra Mussels, juveniles face severe challenges due to habitat avoidance, reduced prey availability, and substrate incompatibility. These challenges are multifaceted and require a comprehensive approach to address the ecological and conservation implications.

### Habitat Avoidance and Prey Depletion

Juvenile Lake Sturgeon, which typically forage on soft-bodied invertebrates such as chironomids and annelids in sandy and silty substrates, are forced to avoid Zebra Mussel-covered habitats. Laboratory experiments have shown that even 50% zebra mussel coverage on the substrate significantly reduces foraging success, and 95% coverage virtually eliminates it. This physical obstruction not only limits access to essential prey but also forces juveniles to seek alternative foraging grounds, often in suboptimal habitats. Additionally, the filter-feeding activity of Zebra Mussels depletes plankton, indirectly reducing the populations of chironomids and other insect larvae that are critical to juvenile diets. This dual impact of habitat alteration and prey depletion poses a significant threat to the survival and growth of juvenile Lake Sturgeon.

### Accelerating Piscivory and Ecological Consequences

In response to these challenges, juvenile Lake Sturgeon have adapted by incorporating invasive Round Goby (*Neogobius melanostomus*) into their diets at smaller sizes, shifting to piscivory earlier than in uninvaded systems. This adaptation can enhance growth rates due to the higher energy content of fish prey, providing a partial solution to the reduced availability of traditional invertebrate prey. However, this shift also introduces uncertainties about long-term ecological stability. The reliance on an invasive species as a primary food source can have cascading effects on the broader ecosystem, potentially leading to unintended consequences such as changes in predator-prey dynamics and altered food web structures.

### Adaptive Management Strategies

To mitigate the impacts of Zebra Mussel colonization on juvenile Lake Sturgeon, adaptive management strategies must be implemented. These strategies should prioritize the protection and restoration of juvenile-specific habitats, including sand/gravel substrates and deep-water refuges free of Zebra Mussel colonization. Physical barriers and early detection programs can help prevent mussel colonization in these critical areas. Ensuring connectivity between juvenile and adult habitats is also crucial to facilitate natural ontogenetic transitions without excessive predation risk.

Monitoring Round Goby populations and assessing their availability in key sturgeon habitats can help identify areas where their abundance can support early piscivory. However, it is essential to monitor the long-term effects of Round Goby consumption on sturgeon health and growth to ensure no unintended consequences arise from reliance on an invasive prey base. Targeted biocontrol agents like *Zequanox* can be deployed in localized areas critical for juvenile sturgeon, such as spawning grounds and nursery habitats, to reduce mussel populations without harming native species.

Restocking programs should avoid releasing small juveniles into heavily invaded areas and focus on restoring connectivity between juvenile and adult habitats. Introducing juveniles into mussel-free tributaries or upstream habitats can minimize exposure during their vulnerable early stages. Ecosystem-level management, including maintaining water quality and restoring native unionid clam populations, can help stabilize benthic communities and reduce the dominance of Zebra Mussels.

### Future Research and Collaborative Efforts

Future research should aim to clarify the nutritional consequences of dietary shifts and assess the feasibility of rehabilitating native benthic communities. Long-term studies are needed to track juvenile growth rates, survival, and reproductive success in Zebra Mussel-impacted versus uninvaded systems. Evaluating the feasibility of reintroducing native prey species or enhancing habitat complexity in ways that support juvenile foraging without favoring Zebra Mussels is also essential.

Collaborative efforts among governments, NGOs, and tribal groups are crucial to address the complex interplay of invasive species and ecosystem engineering. Standardizing protocols for chemical treatments and infrastructure modifications, and enforcing consistent prevention measures and habitat protection policies across multiple jurisdictions, are essential steps toward effective management.
