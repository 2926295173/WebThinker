# Optimizing Freeze-Drying and Transportation to Preserve Bioactive Properties of Camu Camu Berries for USDA Organic and Non-GMO Certification


## Introduction

Camu camu berries (*Myrciaria dubia*), native to the Amazon rainforest, are renowned for their exceptional bioactive properties, including high concentrations of vitamin C, phenolic compounds, and antioxidants. These berries are increasingly sought after for inclusion in health supplements and functional foods due to their potential health benefits, such as anti-inflammatory, antihyperglycemic, and antimicrobial properties. However, preserving these nutrients during processing and transport poses significant challenges due to the berries' perishable nature and sensitivity to environmental conditions. Freeze-drying is a widely adopted method for retaining bioactive compounds in fruits, but optimizing its application for camu camu requires attention to specific parameters such as temperature, pressure, and the use of protective agents.

The Amazon region, with its rich biodiversity, is a primary source of camu camu berries. These berries are distributed across Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela, and are emerging as a standout due to their remarkable nutritional prospects. The composition of camu camu has garnered considerable interest due to its elevated levels of bioactive compounds, such as ascorbic acid, citric acid, and phenolic compounds, including ellagic acid, ellagitannins, and proanthocyanidins. These compounds are known for their potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, surpassing those observed in vitamin C tablets when tested in human subjects. Additionally, studies have reported the potential antiobesity effects of camu camu in a rat model of diet-induced obesity and its antidiabetic activities, indicating its potential in treating chronic diseases.

To develop functional ingredients based on the active properties of camu camu, it is necessary to extract the bioactive compounds from the fruit or the different parts of the plant. This process is often followed by a drying step to facilitate industrial handling. However, some bioactive compounds present low solubility in water or are unstable, making them susceptible to high temperature, light, pH, oxidative stress, and degradative enzymes, which can negatively impact their biological activities. For instance, Neves et al. observed a significant decrease in the total phenolic content of camu camu fruits after 5 days of cold storage under controlled conditions. Consequently, developing strategies to protect and preserve these compounds, particularly under conditions of processing and storage, and to enhance their bioaccessibility and bioavailability is crucial.

Among these strategies, encapsulation has emerged as a promising approach to address this challenge. Encapsulation involves entrapping the bioactive components within a protective matrix, which can slow down degradation processes, prevent the loss of their functionality, and increase bioavailability. Encapsulating bioactive compounds makes it possible to extend their shelf life, improve their stability throughout various processing stages and final use at consumption, and enhance their compatibility with different formulations. Furthermore, the encapsulation strategy could provide controlled release mechanisms and a sustained and targeted delivery of these compounds in the body. Various encapsulation methods have been explored, and recent evidence underscores that microencapsulation is a potent process to enhance the stability and bioavailability of the naturally occurring bioactive compounds in camu camu, such as ascorbic acid and anthocyanins.
