Question: How might the neural oscillatory patterns in the anterior cingulate cortex and insula during speech production differ between individuals with high versus low emotional expressivity when describing a past autobiographical event, and do these patterns interact with individual differences in the functional connectivity between the default mode network and the salience network?

# Neural Oscillatory Patterns and Functional Connectivity in the ACC and Insula During Emotional Speech Production: Differences Between High and Low Expressivity Individuals

## Introduction

Speech production is a complex motor act that involves the coordination of multiple neural systems, including the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and insula, which play crucial roles in both motor control and emotional processing. Neural oscillatory patterns, such as those in the gamma, alpha, and beta frequency bands, are essential for understanding the dynamic interactions within these regions during speech production. The ACC and insula are particularly important for integrating emotional content into speech, making them key areas of interest when studying individual differences in emotional expressivity.

### Hypotheses

Based on the existing literature, we hypothesize that high expressivity individuals will show higher gamma band synchronization in the ACC and insula during speech production, reflecting the integration of emotional and interoceptive signals. Additionally, we expect to observe stronger functional connectivity between the DMN and SN in high expressivity individuals, facilitating the seamless integration of emotional content into speech. Conversely, low expressivity individuals may exhibit weaker or different phase-amplitude coupling between theta and gamma bands, disrupting the flow of information between these networks.

### Neural Oscillatory Patterns in the ACC and Insula

Neural oscillations in the ACC and insula are critical for various cognitive and emotional processes. The ACC, a part of the salience network, is involved in conflict monitoring, error detection, and emotional regulation. During speech production, the ACC helps to coordinate motor planning and execution, ensuring that speech is both fluent and contextually appropriate. Gamma band oscillations (30-60 Hz) in the ACC are often associated with the encoding of precise information, such as the integration of sensory and motor signals. Alpha (8-13 Hz) and beta (15-25 Hz) band oscillations, on the other hand, are linked to motor preparation and execution, with alpha desynchronization (ERD) and beta rebound (ERS) observed in the sensorimotor cortex during speech movements.

The insula, another key component of the salience network, is involved in interoception, the perception of internal bodily states, and the integration of these signals with external sensory information. The insula's role in speech production is multifaceted, including the coordination of respiratory and articulatory movements. Gamma band activity in the insula is associated with the processing of emotional and interoceptive signals, while alpha and beta band oscillations are involved in motor control and the regulation of autonomic functions.

### Roles in Emotional Processing

The ACC and insula are integral to emotional processing, particularly in the context of speech production. The ventral-rostral ACC (vACC) is involved in the regulation of limbic responses, modulating the intensity of emotional expressions. This region has strong connections with the amygdala and hypothalamus, which are crucial for generating emotional responses. The dorsal-caudal ACC (dACC) is involved in the appraisal and expression of negative emotions, integrating cognitive and emotional information to guide appropriate behavioral responses.

The insula, particularly the anterior insula, is involved in the perception and expression of emotions. It integrates interoceptive signals with emotional content, allowing individuals to experience and express emotions more vividly. The insula's connectivity with the prefrontal cortex and motor regions ensures that emotional states are effectively translated into speech, influencing the prosody and articulation of spoken words.

### Significance of Studying Individual Differences in Emotional Expressivity

Individual differences in emotional expressivity, the extent to which individuals display emotions through facial expressions, tone of voice, and other nonverbal cues, are significant for understanding the neural mechanisms underlying speech production. High expressivity individuals tend to show more pronounced emotional vocalizations, while low expressivity individuals may exhibit more subdued or regulated emotional speech. These differences can have important implications for social communication, mental health, and the overall quality of interpersonal interactions.

Studying these individual differences can provide insights into the neural mechanisms that underlie emotional regulation and expression. For example, high expressivity individuals may have stronger ventral ACC-driven limbic activation, resulting in more pronounced emotional vocalizations. Conversely, low expressivity individuals may rely more on dorsal ACC-mediated cognitive appraisal or top-down inhibition to temper emotional speech output. Understanding these mechanisms can inform the development of interventions for individuals with emotional regulation difficulties, such as those with anxiety disorders or autism spectrum disorders.

## Anterior Cingulate Cortex and Insula in Speech Production

The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and insula are critical components of the neural network involved in speech production, each contributing uniquely to the complex processes of motor coordination, interoception, and emotional modulation. Understanding their roles is essential for elucidating the neural mechanisms underlying speech, particularly in the context of emotional expressivity.

### Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC)

The ACC is a key region in the salience network, which is responsible for detecting and integrating salient stimuli, including emotional and cognitive signals. The ACC can be functionally divided into dorsal and ventral subdivisions, each with distinct roles in speech production and emotional processing.

#### Dorsal Anterior Cingulate Cortex (dACC)

The dACC is primarily involved in cognitive and motor functions, including conflict monitoring, error detection, and motor planning. During speech production, the dACC plays a crucial role in the top-down regulation of motor actions, ensuring that the intended speech is accurately executed. Studies have shown that the dACC is activated during tasks requiring speech articulation, such as reading aloud and object naming. This activation suggests that the dACC is involved in the coordination of motor sequences necessary for speech, particularly in the context of task-specific demands and error correction.

#### Ventral Anterior Cingulate Cortex (vACC)

The vACC, on the other hand, is more closely associated with emotional processing and regulation. It is involved in the appraisal and expression of emotional content, modulating limbic responses to emotional stimuli. The vACC's connectivity with limbic regions, such as the amygdala and hypothalamus, allows it to integrate emotional signals with motor actions, ensuring that speech is emotionally congruent. For example, the vACC may be more active during the production of speech with emotional prosody, such as expressing joy or sadness, by coordinating the emotional content with the appropriate motor output.

### Insula

The insula is a multimodal integration hub that processes interoceptive, sensory, and motor information. It is particularly important in speech production due to its role in coordinating autonomic and motor functions. The insula can be divided into anterior and posterior regions, each with distinct contributions to speech.

#### Anterior Insula (AIC)

The AIC is involved in the integration of interoceptive signals and the regulation of autonomic responses. During speech production, the AIC helps to maintain the necessary physiological states, such as respiration and heart rate, which are crucial for fluent speech. The AIC also plays a role in the emotional modulation of speech, contributing to the expression of emotional prosody. Studies have shown that the AIC is activated during tasks requiring the production of emotional speech, such as describing emotionally charged events or expressing feelings.

#### Posterior Insula (PIC)

The PIC is more involved in the sensory and motor aspects of speech production. It processes somatosensory feedback from the articulatory system, ensuring that the motor actions are accurately executed and adjusted in real-time. The PIC's connectivity with motor regions, such as the premotor cortex and supplementary motor area (SMA), allows it to coordinate the fine motor movements required for speech articulation. This region is particularly active during tasks that involve precise control of the articulatory muscles, such as reading aloud or producing complex speech sounds.

### Functional Integration in Speech Production

The ACC and insula work in concert to ensure the smooth and emotionally appropriate production of speech. The dACC's role in motor planning and error detection is complemented by the vACC's role in emotional regulation, allowing for the integration of cognitive and emotional aspects of speech. Similarly, the AIC's integration of interoceptive signals and emotional modulation is supported by the PIC's sensory and motor functions, ensuring that the physiological and motor aspects of speech are coordinated.

## Functional Connectivity Between Default Mode and Salience Networks

The default mode network (DMN) and salience network (SN) are two key large-scale brain networks that play crucial roles in various cognitive and emotional processes. The DMN, primarily active during self-referential and introspective tasks, is involved in autobiographical memory, mentalizing, and self-awareness. The SN, on the other hand, is responsible for detecting and filtering salient stimuli, integrating interoceptive and exteroceptive signals, and modulating the brain's response to emotionally significant events. The interaction between these networks is particularly important during tasks that require self-referential or emotional processing, such as narrating past autobiographical events.

### Co-Activation During Autobiographical Tasks

During tasks that involve recalling and narrating past autobiographical events, the DMN and SN often co-activate, reflecting their complementary roles in emotional and cognitive processing. The DMN retrieves and integrates autobiographical memories, providing the narrative and contextual framework for the event. Simultaneously, the SN detects and processes the emotional salience of the memories, ensuring that the most relevant and emotionally significant aspects are highlighted. This co-activation is essential for generating coherent and emotionally rich narratives.

For instance, studies have shown that during the recall of emotionally charged autobiographical events, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vMPFC) and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), key nodes of the DMN, exhibit increased activity. At the same time, the anterior insula (AIC) and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), core components of the SN, show heightened activation, indicating their role in processing the emotional content of the memories. This coordinated activity suggests that the DMN and SN work together to construct and express emotionally significant autobiographical narratives.

### Modulation of Emotional Expression

The functional connectivity between the DMN and SN is not static but dynamically modulates based on the task demands and the emotional content of the memories. During the narration of past events, the SN can enhance or suppress the DMN's activity, depending on the salience and relevance of the emotional information. This dynamic interaction is crucial for regulating the emotional expression during speech.

For example, in individuals with high emotional expressivity, the SN may exhibit stronger connectivity with the DMN, particularly in the ventral regions of the ACC and insula. This enhanced connectivity could facilitate the integration of emotional details into the narrative, leading to more vivid and expressive speech. Conversely, in individuals with low emotional expressivity, the SN might show weaker connectivity with the DMN, resulting in less emotional modulation and a more subdued narrative.

### Mindfulness and Depression: Examples of Network Connectivity and Expressivity Traits

Studies on mindfulness and depression provide further insights into the functional connectivity between the DMN and SN and its relationship with emotional expressivity. Mindfulness meditation, which enhances emotional regulation and self-awareness, has been shown to increase the functional connectivity between the DMN and SN. This increased connectivity is associated with better emotional regulation and more adaptive emotional expression. Mindfulness practitioners often exhibit more coherent and emotionally rich narratives when recalling past events, suggesting that the enhanced DMN-SN connectivity supports more effective emotional processing and expression.

In contrast, individuals with depression often show disrupted connectivity between the DMN and SN. Depression is characterized by hyperactivity in the DMN and hypoactivity in the SN, leading to difficulties in regulating emotional responses and expressing emotions appropriately. This disrupted connectivity can result in flattened affect and reduced emotional expressivity. Treatment interventions, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and pharmacotherapy, have been shown to normalize DMN-SN connectivity, which is associated with improvements in emotional regulation and expressivity.

### Hypothesized Mechanisms and Future Directions

The interaction between the DMN and SN during autobiographical tasks and emotional expression is a complex and dynamic process. The ventral regions of the ACC and insula, which are part of the SN, play a crucial role in detecting and processing emotional salience. These regions are highly interconnected with the DMN, particularly the vMPFC and PCC, which are involved in autobiographical memory and self-referential processing. The strength and pattern of this connectivity can modulate the emotional content and expressivity of speech.

Future research should aim to directly compare the neural oscillatory patterns and functional connectivity between the DMN and SN in high and low emotional expressivity individuals during speech production tasks involving autobiographical events. This could involve using techniques such as electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure oscillatory activity and connectivity, respectively. Understanding these differences could provide valuable insights into the neural mechanisms underlying individual differences in emotional expressivity and inform the development of targeted interventions to enhance emotional communication and well-being.

## Neural Oscillatory Patterns in ACC and Insula During Emotional Speech Production

### Overview of Oscillatory Patterns in Emotional Tasks

Neural oscillations in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and insula play a crucial role in the processing and expression of emotions. These oscillations are characterized by distinct frequency bands, each associated with specific cognitive and emotional functions. For instance, gamma band oscillations (30-100 Hz) are often linked to the integration of sensory and cognitive information, while theta band oscillations (4-8 Hz) are associated with motor coordination and memory processes. Understanding these oscillatory patterns during emotional tasks can provide insights into their roles in speech production, particularly when individuals describe past autobiographical events.

### Gamma Band Oscillations in Salience Detection and Integration

Gamma band oscillations are particularly important for salience detection and the integration of emotional information. Studies have shown that the ACC and insula exhibit increased gamma activity during tasks involving emotional salience, such as viewing emotionally charged films or pictures. This increased activity suggests that gamma oscillations facilitate the detection and processing of emotionally relevant stimuli. In the context of speech production, high expressivity individuals might show stronger gamma synchronization between the ACC and insula, allowing for better integration of emotional content into their speech. This enhanced integration could result in more vivid and emotionally rich narratives when describing past events.

### Theta Band Oscillations in Motor Coordination

Theta band oscillations are critical for motor coordination and the timing of movements, which are essential for speech production. The ACC and insula are both involved in the motor control of speech, with the insula playing a particularly important role in coordinating articulatory movements and managing autonomic processes like respiration. During speech production, theta oscillations in these regions may help synchronize the timing of motor actions, ensuring smooth and coherent speech. High expressivity individuals might exhibit more robust theta activity in the ACC and insula, reflecting their ability to coordinate emotional and motor aspects of speech effectively. Conversely, low expressivity individuals might show weaker theta activity, leading to less coordinated and less emotionally expressive speech.

### Beta Band Oscillations in Motor Planning and Execution

Beta band oscillations (15-30 Hz) are also relevant to speech production, particularly in the planning and execution of motor movements. The ACC and insula show beta desynchronization (event-related desynchronization, ERD) during speech tasks, indicating the engagement of these regions in motor planning and execution. High expressivity individuals might exhibit more pronounced beta ERD, reflecting their heightened engagement in the motor aspects of speech production. This increased beta activity could facilitate the production of more expressive and dynamic speech, while low expressivity individuals might show less beta ERD, leading to more monotone or less expressive speech.

### Possible Differences Between High and Low Expressivity Individuals

Based on the existing literature, several hypotheses can be proposed regarding the differences in neural oscillatory patterns between high and low expressivity individuals during emotional speech production:

1. **Gamma Band Activity:**
   - **High Expressivity:** Increased gamma activity in the ACC and insula, indicating better integration of emotional content and salience detection.
   - **Low Expressivity:** Reduced gamma activity, suggesting less effective integration of emotional information and weaker salience detection.

2. **Theta Band Activity:**
   - **High Expressivity:** Stronger theta activity, reflecting better motor coordination and timing of speech movements.
   - **Low Expressivity:** Weaker theta activity, leading to less coordinated and less emotionally expressive speech.

3. **Beta Band Activity:**
   - **High Expressivity:** More pronounced beta ERD, indicating greater engagement in motor planning and execution.
   - **Low Expressivity:** Less pronounced beta ERD, suggesting reduced motor engagement and less expressive speech.

### Indirect Evidence from Related Traits

Indirect evidence from studies on traits like mindfulness and alexithymia can provide further insights into the neural mechanisms underlying emotional expressivity. For example, individuals with high mindfulness scores, who are often more emotionally expressive, show stronger functional connectivity between the DMN and SN, including the ACC and insula. This enhanced connectivity might facilitate the integration of emotional and cognitive processes, leading to more expressive speech. Conversely, individuals with alexithymia, characterized by difficulty in identifying and expressing emotions, exhibit reduced ACC activation during emotional tasks. This reduced activation could translate to weaker gamma and theta oscillations in the ACC and insula, resulting in less expressive speech.

## Methodological Considerations

### Limitations

1. **Sample Size and Diversity:**
   - Many studies in this field have small sample sizes, which can limit the generalizability of the findings. Future research should aim to include larger and more diverse samples to better understand the neural mechanisms underlying emotional expressivity across different populations.

2. **Task Variability:**
   - The tasks used to elicit emotional speech can vary widely, which may affect the comparability of results across studies. Standardizing tasks and using a range of emotional stimuli can help to ensure that findings are robust and generalizable.

3. **Neuroimaging Techniques:**
   - Different neuroimaging techniques (e.g., EEG, fMRI, MEG) have varying strengths and limitations. Combining multiple techniques can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the neural mechanisms involved in emotional expressivity. For example, simultaneous EEG/fMRI can capture both the temporal dynamics of neural oscillations and the spatial localization of brain activity.

### Approaches for Future Studies

1. **Multimodal Neuroimaging:**
   - Combining EEG and fMRI can bridge the gap between high temporal resolution (EEG) and high spatial resolution (fMRI). This approach can capture the dynamic oscillatory patterns in the ACC and insula while also mapping the functional connectivity between the DMN and SN during speech production.

2. **Real-Time Speech Tasks:**
   - Conducting real-time speech tasks, such as narrating past autobiographical events, can provide insights into the neural mechanisms that underlie emotional expressivity. These tasks can be designed to elicit a range of emotional expressions, allowing researchers to correlate neural activity with specific aspects of speech production.

3. **Comparative Studies:**
   - Directly comparing high and low expressivity groups can help identify specific neural signatures that differentiate these individuals. This comparison can reveal whether high expressivity involves stronger gamma synchronization in the SN, amplified DMN-SN coupling, or compensatory theta activity in the ACC.

## Discussion

The reviewed literature highlights the pivotal roles of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and insula in integrating emotional and cognitive processes during speech production. However, direct evidence on how their neural oscillatory patterns differentiate between individuals with high and low emotional expressivity remains limited. The salience network (SN) and default mode network (DMN) are likely to interact during autobiographical narration, with the SN amplifying DMN activity to infuse speech with emotional content. This interaction is crucial for understanding the neural mechanisms underlying individual differences in emotional expressivity.

### Neural Oscillatory Patterns in High and Low Expressivity Individuals

#### High Emotional Expressivity
1. **Enhanced Gamma Oscillations in the ACC and Insula:**
   High expressivity individuals may exhibit enhanced gamma band oscillations (30–60 Hz) in the ACC and insula. Gamma activity is associated with salience detection and prediction error signaling, which are critical for encoding emotionally salient details. This heightened gamma activity could translate into richer and more vivid emotional descriptions during speech, allowing these individuals to convey their emotions more effectively.

2. **Stronger Theta Oscillations in the dACC:**
   Theta band oscillations (4–8 Hz) in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) are linked to memory retrieval and sequential planning. High expressivity individuals might show stronger theta oscillations, which could support the retrieval of autobiographical memories and the sequential planning of speech, ensuring that their narratives are coherent and emotionally rich.

3. **Increased Functional Connectivity Between DMN and SN:**
   High expressivity individuals may also exhibit increased functional connectivity between the DMN and SN. This enhanced connectivity allows for seamless integration of autobiographical memories (DMN) with emotional prioritization (SN), resulting in speech that is both contextually accurate and emotionally engaging.

#### Low Emotional Expressivity
1. **Reduced Gamma Activity in the vACC:**
   Low expressivity individuals might display reduced gamma activity in the ventral anterior cingulate cortex (vACC). This reduction could diminish their ability to encode emotionally salient details, leading to less expressive and less emotionally rich speech.

2. **Disrupted Theta-Gamma Coupling:**
   Disrupted theta-gamma coupling in the dACC could impair the seamless transition between memory retrieval and emotional modulation. This disruption might result in fragmented speech or emotional suppression, making it difficult for these individuals to convey their emotions effectively.

3. **Weakened DMN-SN Connectivity:**
   Low expressivity individuals may also show weakened functional connectivity between the DMN and SN. This decoupling could impair the integration of autobiographical memories with emotional content, leading to speech that lacks emotional depth and coherence.

### Proxies for Emotional Expressivity: Mindfulness and Alexithymia

#### Mindfulness
Mindfulness practices, which enhance emotional awareness and regulation, are associated with stronger functional connectivity between the DMN and SN and increased gamma coherence. These neural changes could underlie the improved expressive abilities observed in mindful individuals. Mindfulness training might enhance the ability to detect and integrate emotionally salient information, leading to more expressive and emotionally rich speech.

#### Alexithymia
Alexithymia, characterized by difficulty in identifying and expressing emotions, is associated with reduced ACC activation and decoupling between the DMN and SN. This neural profile may underpin the reduced expressivity observed in alexithymic individuals. The hypoactivation of the ACC and the weakened connectivity between the DMN and SN could impair the ability to detect and integrate emotional salience, leading to less expressive speech.

### Critical Gaps and Future Directions

Despite the inferences drawn from the reviewed literature, several critical gaps remain. No studies have explicitly measured neural oscillatory patterns in the ACC and insula during autobiographical speech production or directly compared high and low expressivity groups. Future research should employ multimodal neuroimaging techniques, such as simultaneous EEG/fMRI, to assess both oscillatory dynamics and network connectivity in real-time during speech tasks. Such studies could provide a more comprehensive understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying individual differences in emotional expressivity.

1. **Multimodal Neuroimaging:**
   Combining EEG and fMRI can bridge the gap between high temporal resolution (EEG) and high spatial resolution (fMRI). This approach can capture the dynamic oscillatory patterns in the ACC and insula while also mapping the functional connectivity between the DMN and SN during speech production.

2. **Real-Time Speech Tasks:**
   Conducting real-time speech tasks, such as narrating past autobiographical events, can provide insights into the neural mechanisms that underlie emotional expressivity. These tasks can be designed to elicit a range of emotional expressions, allowing researchers to correlate neural activity with specific aspects of speech production.

3. **Comparative Studies:**
   Directly comparing high and low expressivity groups can help identify specific neural signatures that differentiate these individuals. This comparison can reveal whether high expressivity involves stronger gamma synchronization in the SN, amplified DMN-SN coupling, or compensatory theta activity in the ACC.

### Implications for Clinical Applications

Understanding the neural mechanisms underlying emotional expressivity can inform the development of targeted therapies for disorders characterized by emotional expression deficits, such as autism and depression. For example, interventions that enhance gamma activity in the ACC and insula or strengthen DMN-SN connectivity could improve emotional expressivity in these populations. Additionally, mindfulness-based interventions, which have been shown to enhance emotional awareness and regulation, could be adapted to specifically target the neural mechanisms involved in emotional expressivity.

### Clarification of Oscillatory Patterns and DMN-SN Interaction

The interaction between the default mode network (DMN) and the salience network (SN) is crucial for the integration of emotional and cognitive processes during speech production. High expressivity individuals may exhibit stronger gamma band oscillations in the ACC and insula, reflecting enhanced salience detection and integration of emotional content. This enhanced gamma activity, coupled with stronger functional connectivity between the DMN and SN, allows for the seamless integration of autobiographical memories with emotional prioritization, resulting in more vivid and emotionally rich speech. Conversely, low expressivity individuals may show weaker or disrupted theta-gamma coupling in the dACC, leading to less effective integration of memory and emotional content, and weaker DMN-SN connectivity, resulting in less expressive speech.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the existing literature provides a robust framework for understanding the neural mechanisms underlying differences in emotional expressivity during autobiographical speech production. High expressivity individuals are hypothesized to exhibit stronger gamma oscillations in the ACC and insula, reflecting enhanced salience detection and the ability to integrate emotional content into their speech. This heightened gamma activity, coupled with robust functional connectivity between the DMN and SN, allows for seamless integration of autobiographical memories with emotional prioritization, resulting in richer and more expressive speech.

Conversely, low expressivity individuals may display reduced gamma activity in the ACC and insula, diminishing their ability to detect and encode emotionally salient details. Disrupted theta-gamma coupling and weakened functional connectivity between the DMN and SN in low expressivity individuals can lead to fragmented speech or emotional suppression, impairing the integration of cognitive and affective components.

Mindfulness and alexithymia serve as useful proxies for understanding the neural mechanisms underlying emotional expressivity. Mindfulness, characterized by high emotional awareness and expressivity, is associated with stronger DMN-SN connectivity and gamma coherence, which may enhance expressive abilities. In contrast, alexithymia, marked by poor emotional insight, is linked to reduced ACC activation and DMN-SN decoupling, potentially underpinning reduced expressivity.

Future research must employ advanced neuroimaging techniques, such as simultaneous EEG/fMRI, to directly test these hypotheses. Such studies could provide a more comprehensive understanding of how oscillatory dynamics (e.g., theta-gamma coupling) mediate the interplay between the DMN and SN during speech production. By combining the high temporal resolution of EEG with the high spatial resolution of fMRI, researchers can track real-time oscillatory changes in the ACC and insula while simultaneously assessing functional connectivity between the DMN and SN. This integrated approach could reveal the precise mechanisms by which individual differences in emotional expressivity are reflected in both local oscillations and large-scale network dynamics.

Understanding the neural basis of emotional expressivity has significant implications for clinical applications. Disorders characterized by expressive deficits, such as autism and depression, may benefit from interventions that target the ACC, insula, and their interactions with the DMN and SN. For example, therapies that enhance gamma oscillations in the ACC and insula or strengthen DMN-SN connectivity could improve emotional expression and communication in affected individuals. Additionally, the use of neurofeedback techniques, which allow individuals to modulate their own brain activity, may offer a promising avenue for enhancing emotional expressivity in clinical settings.

In summary, the existing literature provides a compelling framework for understanding the complex relationship between neural oscillations, network connectivity, and individual differences in emotional expressivity. While direct empirical evidence is still needed, theoretical and indirect findings suggest that high expressivity is associated with stronger gamma oscillations and enhanced DMN-SN coupling, while low expressivity involves reduced oscillatory coherence and disrupted network interactions. Future research using advanced neuroimaging techniques will be crucial for validating these hypotheses and advancing our understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying emotional communication.
