The myth of Romulus and Remus is not just a historical narrative; it is a foundational story that underscores the importance of civic responsibility. The twins' journey from abandonment to leadership highlights the values of resilience, unity, and the establishment of rules and laws that are essential for a well-functioning community. By exploring these themes, students can learn how to contribute positively to their own communities and understand the role of civic responsibility in modern society.

This article provides a comprehensive framework for educators to effectively utilize the myth of Romulus and Remus in their fourth-grade social studies curriculum.

By following this framework, educators can ensure that the myth of Romulus and Remus not only captivates students but also enriches their understanding of community building and civic responsibility.

## Historical and Cultural Significance of Romulus and Remus

The myth of Romulus and Remus is a foundational narrative that holds profound historical and cultural significance in Roman society. Born to the war god Mars and the Vestal Virgin Rhea Silvia, the twins were abandoned as infants but survived through the intervention of a she-wolf and a shepherd couple. This miraculous survival and subsequent upbringing set the stage for their extraordinary destinies and the eventual founding of Rome.

### Origins and Early Life

The story begins with a prophecy that foretold the birth of twins who would overthrow King Amulius of Alba Longa. Rhea Silvia, a Vestal Virgin, became pregnant after being visited by Mars, the god of war. To avoid the wrath of King Amulius, who had ordered her to remain celibate, Rhea Silvia placed the twins in a basket and set them adrift on the Tiber River. Miraculously, they were rescued by a she-wolf, who nurtured them and provided for their needs. This iconic image of the she-wolf nursing Romulus and Remus has become a symbol of Rome itself, representing both the city’s origins and the nurturing aspects of its early society.

### The Founding of Rome

As the twins grew older, they became embroiled in a rivalry that would ultimately lead to the founding of Rome. After overthrowing Amulius and restoring their grandfather Numitor to the throne, Romulus and Remus decided to establish a new city. However, a dispute arose over the location and the design of the city walls. Romulus favored the Palatine Hill, while Remus preferred the Aventine Hill. To determine the auspicious signs, they sought divine guidance by observing the flight of birds. Remus claimed to have seen six vultures first, while Romulus insisted that he witnessed twelve. This disagreement led to a heated argument, and in a fit of rage, Romulus struck Remus down, symbolizing the cost of ambition and the necessity of sacrifice for Rome’s survival.

### Establishment of Governance

Following the tragic conflict, Romulus founded the city of Rome in 753 BCE. He established its initial governance, including laws and institutions that would shape Roman society. Romulus’s rule is often viewed as a blend of military strength and political acumen, laying the groundwork for the Roman Republic and later the Empire. The establishment of the Senate, the creation of the Roman legions, and the organization of social and political institutions reflect the Roman values of discipline, efficiency, and order.

### Symbolic Significance

The she-wolf nursing the twins has become an enduring symbol of Rome’s resilience and strength. The Capitoline Wolf, a famous bronze statue, immortalizes this image and serves as a powerful symbol of Rome’s origins and strength. The fig tree (Ficus Ruminalis) and Palatine Hill are also significant, marking the twins’ survival and the city’s birthplace. These symbols reinforce the idea of Rome as a city born from struggle and resilience, embodying both the nurturing and martial aspects of Roman society.

### Cultural and Political Impact

The myth of Romulus and Remus played a crucial role in shaping Roman identity and nationalism. It provided a mythological foundation for the Roman people, fostering a sense of pride in their origins and destiny. The narrative encapsulates key Roman values, including loyalty, honor, and the importance of community. Their rivalry and Romulus’s eventual supremacy reflect the competitive spirit that was central to Roman society. The myth also served as a foundation myth for Rome, marking the precise moment of the city’s birth and providing Romans with a shared history and purpose.

### Artistic and Literary Legacy

The story of Romulus and Remus has inspired numerous artistic and literary works throughout history. The Capitoline Wolf statue, a renowned bronze sculpture, has become an iconic representation of Rome’s origins. Ancient Roman coins often featured images of the she-wolf and the twins, symbolizing Rome’s strength and origin. Poets like Virgil and Ovid incorporated elements of the myth into their writings, emphasizing its themes and significance. Modern interpretations in film and media, such as the film "Romulus and Remus: The First King," continue to explore the myth, showcasing its relevance in contemporary storytelling.

### Legacy in Modern Culture

The myth of Romulus and Remus continues to resonate in modern culture, symbolizing themes of conflict, unity, and the quest for identity. It serves as a reminder of the complexities inherent in founding a nation and the importance of ethical leadership. The story’s enduring legacy encourages reflection on our own narratives of origin and identity, inviting further exploration into the rich tapestry of Roman mythology.

For fourth-grade students, understanding these elements can spark curiosity about ancient civilizations and the evolution of societal norms. The myth provides a basis for exploring universal themes of conflict resolution, ethical leadership, and the formation of communities, making it a valuable tool for teaching community building and civic responsibility. By engaging with the story of Romulus and Remus, students can gain insights into the values and beliefs that shaped one of history’s greatest civilizations.

## Addressing Controversial Themes: Violence and Fratricide

When introducing the myth of Romulus and Remus to fourth graders, educators must proactively address its violent elements—specifically Remus’ death and the “Rape of the Sabine Women”—to ensure students engage critically without internalizing harmful messages. Below are strategies for navigating these themes:

### 1. Contextualize Within Ancient Society
The myth of Romulus and Remus reflects the values and beliefs of ancient Roman society, where violence was often seen as a means to resolve disputes or achieve greatness. It is important to explain to students that while the story may depict violent actions, these were part of a different cultural context. Contrast this with modern ethics, which prioritize peaceful conflict resolution and mutual respect. For example, you can discuss how ancient Romans might have viewed Romulus’ actions as necessary for the survival and growth of Rome, while today, we emphasize the importance of dialogue and compromise.

### 2. Frame Violence as a Cautionary Tale
Highlight the consequences of Romulus and Remus’ rivalry, such as Remus’ death, to discuss the importance of collaboration over competition. This can be a powerful lesson in the dangers of unresolved conflict. Encourage students to brainstorm alternative endings where the brothers resolve their conflict peacefully. For instance, they could imagine a scenario where Romulus and Remus work together to build the city, emphasizing the value of teamwork and mutual respect. This exercise reinforces lessons on empathy and civic responsibility, showing that even in the face of disagreement, finding common ground is possible.

### 3. Focus on Constructive Outcomes
Direct attention to the positive results of the myth, such as Romulus’ establishment of laws and institutions (e.g., the Senate) to govern Rome fairly. This shift underscores how even flawed decisions can lead to efforts to rebuild and strengthen communities. Discuss how Romulus’ actions, despite their initial violence, ultimately contributed to the creation of a structured and fair society. This can help students understand that while mistakes can be made, it is important to learn from them and work towards positive change.

### 4. Separate Fact from Fiction
Clearly distinguish between the myth’s symbolic elements (e.g., the she-wolf) and historical facts about Rome’s founding. Use this to teach critical thinking about legends versus reality. Explain that while the myth is a story that has been passed down through generations, it is not a literal historical account. Encourage students to question the sources of information and consider the motivations behind the story. This can help them develop a more nuanced understanding of how myths and legends shape cultural identities.

### 5. Encourage Empathy Through Role-Play
Have students role-play scenarios from the myth, such as the brothers’ argument, to experience the emotions and pressures of their situation. This can help them develop empathy and a deeper understanding of the characters’ motivations. Follow-up discussions can explore better ways to handle disagreements. For example, students can discuss how they would have resolved the conflict between Romulus and Remus, emphasizing the importance of communication and understanding.

### 6. Avoid Graphic Details
Simplify violent scenes to focus on their impact rather than gory specifics. For example, describe Remus’ death as a tragic result of unresolved conflict rather than emphasizing the method of his demise. This approach allows students to engage with the story’s themes without being overwhelmed by graphic content. Emphasize the emotional and social consequences of violence, such as the loss of a brother and the impact on the community, to foster a more thoughtful and reflective discussion.

### 7. Connect to Modern Values
Use the myth to launch discussions about contemporary issues like bullying, fairness, and the role of rules in maintaining harmony. Compare Romulus’ actions to modern leaders who prioritize peace and community well-being. For example, you can discuss how modern leaders use diplomacy and negotiation to resolve conflicts, and how rules and laws help maintain order and protect citizens. This connection helps students see the relevance of the myth to their own lives and the world around them.

### Summary of Strategies

## Roman Values and Societal Norms Reflected in the Myth

The myth of Romulus and Remus is a rich tapestry that weaves together several Roman values and societal norms, providing a valuable framework for exploring historical and cultural perspectives in the classroom. By examining these values, students can gain a deeper understanding of ancient Roman society and draw connections to modern civic responsibilities and ethical considerations.

### 1. Leadership and Authority

Romulus’ decisive nature and his establishment of the Senate are central to the myth, reflecting the Roman emphasis on strong leadership and organized governance. Romulus’ actions in founding Rome and setting up its initial governmental structures demonstrate the importance of leadership in creating a stable and well-ordered community. In the classroom, this can be explored through discussions on the role of leaders in making rules and laws that benefit the community. Students can be encouraged to think about how rules and laws contribute to a stable and harmonious society, and how leaders can inspire and guide their communities.

### 2. Resilience and Perseverance

The twins’ survival against significant adversity—abandonment, exposure to the elements, and being nursed by a she-wolf—highlights the Roman admiration for resilience and perseverance. This theme can be particularly resonant with students, as it relates to their own experiences of overcoming challenges. By discussing the twins’ journey, educators can foster a sense of determination and the belief that even in the face of difficult circumstances, one can find strength and continue to move forward. Activities such as sharing personal stories of resilience or creating visual representations of overcoming obstacles can help students internalize this value.

### 3. Divine Destiny

The myth of Romulus and Remus is deeply rooted in the belief in divine destiny. Their divine parentage (Mars and Rhea Silvia) and their miraculous survival by a she-wolf reflect ancient Roman beliefs in fate and the gods’ influence over human affairs. This can be contrasted with modern understandings of leadership and responsibility, where individuals are seen as having more control over their destinies. In the classroom, discussions can explore the role of fate versus personal choice, and how different cultures interpret the concept of destiny. Students can be encouraged to reflect on how their own actions and decisions shape their lives.

### 4. Unity and Compromise

While the myth of Romulus and Remus includes a tragic conflict that ends in fratricide, it also contains examples of unity and compromise. The intervention of the Sabine women, who mediated peace between the Romans and the Sabines, is a powerful illustration of the importance of compromise in building and maintaining communities. This theme can be used to teach students about the value of collaboration and the benefits of resolving conflicts through dialogue and mutual understanding. Role-playing exercises where students negotiate and find common ground can help reinforce these lessons.

### 5. Military Strength and Expansion

The myth underscores Rome’s martial heritage, with Romulus’ actions often reflecting the Roman emphasis on military strength and expansion. However, it is important to balance this by discussing the consequences of aggression, such as the tragic death of Remus, and the benefits of peaceful alliances. This can lead to discussions on the ethical implications of using force to achieve goals and the importance of diplomacy and cooperation in modern society. Students can be encouraged to think about how leaders can promote peace and stability through non-violent means.

### 6. Community Building

Romulus’ invitation to exiles and outcasts to populate Rome illustrates the Roman value of inclusivity and the belief that a diverse community is stronger. This theme can be connected to modern concepts of immigration and teamwork, emphasizing how different backgrounds and perspectives can enrich a community. Activities such as creating a classroom “community” where each student contributes a unique aspect of their identity can help students understand the value of diversity and collaboration.

### Discussion Prompts

- **How did Romulus’ actions reflect Roman values of strength and leadership?**
- **Why might the Romans have chosen a wolf—a wild animal—to represent their community’s origins?**

By contextualizing these values, students can appreciate historical perspectives while contrasting them with contemporary ideals of empathy and non-violence. This approach not only enriches their understanding of ancient Roman society but also fosters critical thinking and ethical reflection, essential skills for responsible citizenship in the modern world.

## Age-Appropriate Methods for Engaging 4th Graders

To address the myth’s complex themes effectively, educators should employ strategies tailored to fourth graders’ cognitive and emotional development. These methods ensure the content remains accessible and emotionally safe while fostering critical thinking and empathy.

Resources like Twinkl’s illustrated eBook provide a simplified version that focuses on key events such as the twins being abandoned, their rescue by the she-wolf, and the founding of Rome. By omitting violent scenes, these retellings allow students to engage with the narrative’s core themes of leadership, resilience, and community building. For example, the eBook can be used to highlight the she-wolf’s nurturing role and the twins’ journey from abandonment to becoming leaders.

### 2. Interactive Storytelling
Interactive storytelling methods, such as storytelling circles or dramatizations, can make the myth come alive for fourth graders. Encourage students to imagine themselves in the twins’ shoes and discuss how they would handle similar situations. For instance, you might ask, “What would you do if you argued with your sibling over something important?” This approach helps students connect emotionally with the characters and explore the ethical dimensions of the story. Storytelling circles can also foster a sense of community and shared learning, as students take turns narrating different parts of the myth.

### 3. Visual and Creative Projects
Visual and creative projects can enhance students' understanding and engagement with the myth. Here are some ideas:

- **Dioramas**: Have students build models of Rome’s founding to visualize the creation of a community. This hands-on activity can help them understand the importance of planning and collaboration in building a city.
- **Comic Strips**: Students can illustrate the myth with captions that highlight themes like teamwork, fairness, and leadership. This activity encourages them to think critically about the story’s events and their implications.
- **Rewriting Endings**: As suggested by Twinkl’s activities, students can reimagine the story’s conclusion to emphasize non-violent conflict resolution. For example, they might write an alternative ending where Romulus and Remus work together to build the city, reinforcing the value of cooperation and compromise.

### 4. Guided Questions and Reflection
Using open-ended questions can help students explore the ethical dimensions of the myth without imposing adult judgments. Here are some examples of questions to guide reflection:

- **Was Romulus right to build Rome’s walls alone?** This question encourages students to consider the consequences of unilateral decision-making and the importance of seeking input from others.
- **How would you help two friends who disagree on a project?** This question prompts students to think about conflict resolution strategies and the value of mediation and compromise.

By facilitating these discussions, teachers can help students develop critical thinking skills and a deeper understanding of the myth’s themes.

### 5. Connecting to Modern Values
Relating the myth’s themes to students’ lives can make the content more relevant and engaging. For example, you might compare Romulus’ laws to classroom rules, asking how both promote safety and cooperation. Discuss how modern leaders and communities work to resolve conflicts peacefully and build inclusive environments. This connection helps students see the relevance of ancient myths to contemporary issues and values.

### 6. Safe Emotional Climate
Creating a safe and supportive emotional climate is crucial when discussing sensitive topics. Establish clear discussion rules, such as “listen respectfully” and “raise hands,” to ensure that all students feel heard and valued. Provide anonymous contribution options, such as digital platforms like Padlet, for shy or anxious students to share their thoughts. This approach ensures that all students can participate in the discussion without fear of judgment or embarrassment.

### 7. Positive Reinforcement
Highlighting constructive outcomes can help balance the darker elements of the myth and reinforce positive values. For example, celebrate the twins’ resilience and Romulus’ later efforts to unite people through inclusive policies. Emphasize how even flawed decisions can lead to efforts to rebuild and strengthen communities. Recognize and reinforce positive behaviors and contributions in the classroom, such as students who demonstrate empathy, cooperation, and leadership.

By employing these age-appropriate methods, educators can effectively engage fourth graders with the myth of Romulus and Remus, fostering critical thinking, empathy, and a deeper understanding of historical and cultural values.

- **Contextualization**: Explain that the myth of Romulus and Remus is a story from ancient Roman culture, not a literal historical account. This helps students understand that the violent elements are part of a cultural narrative rather than a model for modern behavior.
- **Clarification**: Clearly state that while the myth reflects the values and beliefs of ancient Romans, modern society has different ethical standards. Emphasize that the story is a tool for learning about history and cultural values, not for endorsing violence.
- **Discussion Prompts**:
  - “How do the values in the myth compare to our values today?”
  - “What can we learn from the story about leadership and community building?”

### 3. Parental Communication

**Informing Parents and Guardians:**
- **Overview**: Send a brief overview of the lesson and its objectives to parents and guardians. Explain the educational value of the myth and how it will be presented in a sensitive and age-appropriate manner.
- **Alternative Activities**: Offer optional alternative activities for families who may be uncomfortable with the content. This could include reading a different myth or a historical account that aligns with the curriculum goals.
- **Open Communication**: Encourage parents to share any concerns or feedback, and be prepared to address them thoughtfully and respectfully.

### 4. Emotional Check-ins

**Creating a Supportive Emotional Climate:**
- **Feelings Circles**: Begin and end lessons with “feelings circles” where students can share how the story makes them feel. This helps students process their emotions and ensures that any concerns are addressed.
- **Addressing Concerns**: Listen to students’ feelings and concerns openly and validate their experiences. Redirect discussions to focus on ethical learning and constructive outcomes.
- **Safe Space**: Create a safe and supportive environment where students feel comfortable expressing their thoughts and emotions without fear of judgment.

### 5. Focus on Solutions

**Shifting the Conversation to Constructive Outcomes:**
- **Constructive Outcomes**: Emphasize the positive aspects of the myth, such as Romulus’ establishment of laws and the founding of Rome. Discuss how these actions contributed to the stability and growth of the community.
- **Ethical Reflection**: Encourage students to reflect on the ethical implications of the myth. Ask questions like:
  - “What rules would you create for a new community to avoid conflicts like those between Romulus and Remus?”
  - “How can we resolve disagreements peacefully in our own lives?”
- **Role-Playing**: Use role-playing exercises to explore alternative scenarios where the brothers resolve their conflict without violence. This helps students develop problem-solving and conflict resolution skills.

### 6. Differentiated Instruction

**Accommodating Diverse Learning Styles:**
- **Multiple Engagement Methods**: Provide a variety of ways for students to engage with the material, such as:
  - **Art Projects**: Create visual representations of the myth, such as dioramas or comic strips.

### 7. Model Respectful Dialogue

**Demonstrating and Encouraging Respectful Communication:**
- **Role-Playing Scenarios**: Demonstrate how to disagree respectfully by role-playing scenarios yourself. Show students how to express differing opinions without being confrontational or disrespectful.
- **Encouraging Students**: Encourage students to practice respectful dialogue during discussions and debates. Provide feedback and reinforcement to help them develop these skills.
