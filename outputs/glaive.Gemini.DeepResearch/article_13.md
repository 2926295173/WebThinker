# **The Potential Influence of Sulfur-Rich Presolar Grains on Refractory Element Condensation and Isotopic Heterogeneities in Allende CAIs**

## **Introduction**

The genesis of our solar system began with the gravitational collapse of a molecular cloud, leading to the formation of a protoplanetary disk surrounding the young Sun 1. Within this early solar nebula, the initial solid materials to condense from the hot, gaseous environment were highly refractory substances, enriched in elements such as calcium and aluminum 3. Among these primordial solids are Calcium-Aluminum-rich Inclusions (CAIs), which are considered the oldest objects to have formed in the solar system, predating even the formation of planets 3. The study of these inclusions provides critical insights into the physical and chemical conditions that prevailed during the solar system's infancy.

Interspersed within the material that formed the solar nebula were presolar grains, microscopic dust particles that originated in the outflows and explosive deaths of stars that existed before our Sun 1. These stellar remnants are identifiable by their highly unusual isotopic compositions, which reflect the unique nuclear processes that occurred in their parent stars 1. Their survival through the solar system's formation and incorporation into meteorites offers a direct means to investigate the composition of stars that contributed to the solar nebula.

Calcium and aluminum, due to their high condensation temperatures, were among the first elements to solidify in the cooling nebula 3. As major constituents of CAIs, their abundance and isotopic compositions within these inclusions serve as important indicators of the high-temperature environments and condensation processes that characterized the early solar system 9. Calcium-aluminum-rich inclusions are commonly found in primitive meteorites, with the Allende meteorite, a CV3 carbonaceous chondrite, being particularly rich in these ancient objects 5. CAIs from Allende exhibit isotopic heterogeneities in various elements, providing crucial clues about the conditions and sources of material in the early solar nebula 9. This report aims to explore the potential influence of sulfur-rich presolar grains on the condensation of these refractory elements and the resulting isotopic diversity observed in Allende CAIs.

## **Characteristics of Sulfur-Rich Presolar Grains**

Primitive meteorites host a variety of presolar grains, each with distinct mineralogical and isotopic characteristics that reflect their stellar origins 10. The most abundant types include silicates, silicon carbide (SiC), graphite, aluminum oxide (Al2O3), and magnesium aluminum oxide (MgAl2O4) 10. Less common but still identified are silicon nitride (Si3N4) and titanium carbide (TiC) 16, as well as nanodiamonds 10. The diversity of these grain types underscores the multitude of stellar environments that contributed dust to the early solar nebula.

Sulfur has been detected as a trace element within presolar silicon carbide (SiC) grains 19. Studies using advanced techniques like NanoSIMS have enabled the measurement of sulfur isotopic compositions and abundances in these grains. Mainstream SiC grains, which constitute the vast majority of presolar SiC, generally exhibit low sulfur abundances, with CI chondrite-normalized S/Si ratios ranging from 2 × 10−5 to 2 × 10−4 19. The sulfur isotopic compositions in these mainstream grains are typically close to solar values, suggesting that their parent stars had sulfur isotopic compositions similar to that of the Sun or the interstellar medium 19.

However, certain rare types of SiC grains, such as Type AB and Type C grains, show significant enrichments in the isotope 32S 19. This excess of 32S is hypothesized to be the result of the in-situ decay of radioactive 32Si (with a half-life of approximately 172 years) that was incorporated into the grains during their condensation in the outflows of born-again AGB stars (for Type AB) or supernovae (for Type C) 19. Furthermore, calcium sulfide (CaS) subgrains have been occasionally observed as inclusions within presolar SiC grains 53, indicating localized sulfur-rich conditions during the formation of these composite grains. While iron sulfide (FeS) is a common sulfur-bearing mineral in meteorites 32, its definitive identification as a presolar phase with anomalous isotopic compositions is less common compared to other grain types.

Presolar silicon carbide (SiC) is relatively abundant in primitive meteorites, typically found at concentrations of tens of parts per million (ppm) 19. Presolar silicate grains are even more abundant, reaching hundreds of ppm in some meteorites and even higher in anhydrous interplanetary dust particles (IDPs) 16. However, the abundance of presolar grains that are significantly enriched in sulfur, where sulfur is a major component rather than a trace element, is not well-established. Studies often report low overall sulfur abundances relative to silicon or other major elements within the grains 19.

The majority of presolar SiC grains, known as mainstream grains, are believed to have originated in the winds of low-mass carbon-rich asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars 17. Type X and C SiC grains, which can exhibit 32S enrichments, are thought to have formed in the ejecta of Type II supernovae 17. AB-type SiC grains, also sometimes showing 32S excesses, might originate from J-type carbon stars or born-again AGB stars 18. Novae, stellar explosions on white dwarf stars, are potential sources for a small fraction of SiC and graphite grains and can also produce sulfur isotopes 17. Supernovae are also considered sources for nanodiamonds and some graphite grains 17.

## **Condensation of Calcium and Aluminum in the Early Solar Nebula**

The condensation sequence provides a theoretical framework for understanding the order in which elements and compounds solidified from the cooling gas of the early solar nebula, assuming thermodynamic equilibrium 65. This model is fundamental to interpreting the formation of the first solids in our solar system. According to this sequence, the most refractory elements, including calcium, aluminum, and titanium, would have been the first to condense at very high temperatures, exceeding 1400 Kelvin 3.

The initial minerals predicted to condense are oxides of these refractory elements, such as corundum (Al2O3), hibonite (CaAl12O19), and perovskite (CaTiO3) 5. Following these, as the nebula continued to cool, other calcium and aluminum-bearing minerals like melilite (a solid solution of gehlenite Ca2Al2SiO7 and åkermanite Ca2MgSi2O7) and spinel (MgAl2O4) would have formed 5. Melilite typically condenses shortly after the initial refractory oxides, while spinel can form through reactions involving corundum and melilite at slightly lower temperatures.

Based on thermodynamic calculations for a solar nebula with a total pressure of 10^-3 atmospheres, corundum (Al2O3) is predicted to condense at approximately 1742 Kelvin 5. Perovskite (CaTiO3) appears at around 1632 Kelvin 5, and hibonite (CaAl12O19) also condenses above 1400 Kelvin 7. Gehlenite-rich melilite (Ca2Al2SiO7) starts condensing around 1608 Kelvin 5, reacting to form spinel and increasing its åkermanite content as the temperature decreases. Melilite reacts completely to form diopside and more spinel at 1442 Kelvin 5. Spinel (MgAl2O4) forms through the reaction of corundum with the nebular gas at about 1533 Kelvin 5.

The equilibrium condensation sequence and the specific temperatures of condensation are not static but are influenced by the physical and chemical conditions within the solar nebula, primarily pressure and gas composition 5. The partial pressures of the constituent elements and the overall nebula pressure can shift these temperatures 5. The oxygen fugacity, reflecting the effective partial pressure of oxygen, is particularly important for oxide mineral stability. An increased oxygen to hydrogen (O/H) ratio can elevate condensation temperatures for refractory elements 7. Furthermore, the assumption of perfect equilibrium might not always be valid in the dynamic nebula 3, and non-equilibrium processes could lead to deviations from the predicted sequence.

**Table 1: Condensation Temperatures of Key Refractory Minerals**

| Mineral | Chemical Formula | Condensation Temperature (K) at 10^-3 atm | Reference Snippet(s) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Corundum | Al2O3 | 1742 | 5 |
| Perovskite | CaTiO3 | 1632 | 5 |
| Hibonite | CaAl12O19 | \>1400 | 7 |
| Gehlenite | Ca2Al2SiO7 | 1608 | 5 |
| Spinel | MgAl2O4 | 1533 | 5 |

## **Potential Chemical Interactions Between Sulfur and Refractory Elements**

Under the reducing conditions thought to have prevailed in the early solar nebula, hydrogen sulfide (H2S) was likely the dominant sulfur-bearing gas species 56. The partial pressure of H2S would have been determined by the total sulfur abundance and the redox state of the nebula, which was influenced by the abundance of oxygen 56. Thermodynamic considerations suggest that under certain conditions, sulfur could have directly condensed into refractory phases alongside or instead of oxygen 57. The specific conditions would dictate the preferred chemical form of calcium and aluminum.

Experimental studies have demonstrated that calcium sulfide (CaS), or oldhamite, can condense from a vapor phase containing calcium and sulfur at high temperatures 58. These experiments also indicate the formation of CaS or solid solutions of CaS and CaO under various oxygen partial pressures 58. Aluminum reacts readily with sulfur at elevated temperatures to form aluminum sulfide (Al2S3) 66, an exothermic reaction occurring above 1100 °C 68. However, Al2S3 is highly reactive with water, hydrolyzing to form hydrated aluminum oxides or hydroxides and H2S 68. Given the presence of water vapor in the early solar nebula, the long-term stability of Al2S3 as a primary condensate might have been limited. Calcium sulfide, while more stable in the presence of water, can still be oxidized to calcium sulfate (CaSO4) under more oxidizing conditions 58.

The presence of sulfur in the early solar nebula, particularly if locally enriched by sulfur-rich presolar grains, could have altered the condensation pathways of calcium and aluminum. Instead of solely forming oxides, these elements might have also condensed as sulfides (CaS, potentially Al2S3 in localized anhydrous regions) if the local sulfur partial pressure was sufficiently high and oxygen partial pressure low. The condensation temperatures of sulfides might differ from those of their corresponding oxides. For example, CaS has a high melting point 71, suggesting condensation at high temperatures. Sulfur could also potentially be incorporated into the crystal structures of calcium and aluminum-bearing oxides or silicates, affecting their stability and growth 72.

## **Isotopic Heterogeneities in Calcium and Aluminum in Allende CAIs**

Calcium-Aluminum-rich Inclusions (CAIs) from the Allende meteorite exhibit notable isotopic anomalies in several elements, including calcium. A prominent feature is the widespread excess in the neutron-rich isotope 48Ca 9, with variations in magnitude across different CAIs. Another key isotopic signature is the evidence for the presence of the short-lived radionuclide 26Al at the time of CAI formation 13, inferred from excesses of its daughter product 26Mg. Most CAIs show a relatively uniform initial 26Al/27Al ratio. Furthermore, mass-dependent isotopic fractionation effects in calcium have been observed 27, with Group II REE pattern CAIs tending to have lighter calcium isotopic compositions.

Isotopic heterogeneities are observed both between different CAIs and within individual inclusions. Oxygen isotopic compositions can vary between mineral phases within a single CAI 33. Different types of CAIs (coarse-grained vs. fine-grained) often show distinct isotopic characteristics, with fine-grained CAIs typically exhibiting more variability 9. Internal heterogeneity in 48Ca has been observed in some Type B CAIs, with melilite showing enrichments 9.

**Table 2: Summary of Isotopic Anomalies in Calcium and Aluminum in Allende CAIs**

| Element | Isotope(s) | Type of Anomaly | Magnitude (Typical Range) | Reference Snippet(s) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Calcium | 48Ca | Excess | Up to \+6ε units | 35, 25, 26, 40, 9 |
| Calcium | Multiple | Mass-dependent fractionation | \~2.8‰ difference in 44/40Ca | 27, 29, 31 |
| Aluminum | 26Al | Presence (inferred) | Initial 26Al/27Al \~5×10^-5 | 34, 38, 28, 48, 13 |

## **Mechanisms Linking Sulfur-Rich Presolar Grains to CAI Isotopic Heterogeneities**

The incorporation of sulfur-rich presolar grains into the early solar nebula could have created localized regions with elevated sulfur abundance. Vaporization or reactions of these grains might have released sulfur-bearing species, potentially affecting the condensation of other elements. The presence of sulfur could also have influenced local redox conditions. These localized chemical perturbations might have altered the condensation environment for refractory elements in the vicinity of these grains.

Sulfur's presence could have affected the kinetics of condensation of calcium and aluminum-bearing minerals, potentially leading to isotopic fractionation. The formation of sulfide phases might have preferentially incorporated certain isotopes of calcium or aluminum compared to oxide or silicate phases. Sulfur-induced changes in oxygen fugacity could also indirectly influence the isotopic composition of refractory elements.

It is not immediately clear if sulfur incorporation can directly explain the observed 48Ca excesses or the specific 26Al-26Mg systematics in CAIs, as these are often attributed to nucleosynthetic sources and radioactive decay. However, sulfur might have indirectly influenced the incorporation or preservation of these isotopic signatures by affecting the mineral phases that host these elements. The correlation between Group II REE patterns and lighter Ca isotopes in some CAIs might be linked to volatility during evaporation/condensation processes, and sulfur could potentially play a role in such processes.

## **Alternative Theories for CAI Isotopic Heterogeneities**

Several alternative models have been proposed to explain the isotopic anomalies observed in Allende CAIs. One prominent theory suggests that these heterogeneities reflect the **incomplete homogenization of presolar material** within the early solar nebula 2. Different presolar grains, originating from various stars, would have possessed distinct isotopic compositions. If the material that formed CAIs was not thoroughly mixed, these initial isotopic differences could have been preserved, potentially explaining anomalies like the 48Ca excesses 9.

Another mechanism involves **irradiation effects** from the young Sun 14. High-energy particles could have interacted with the nebular gas or dust, inducing nuclear reactions that produced or altered isotopes, leading to anomalies in CAIs. The presence of 10Be is often cited as evidence for such irradiation 14.

**Evaporation and recondensation processes** are also considered significant 3. High-temperature events in the early solar nebula could have caused CAI precursors to partially or completely evaporate, with subsequent recondensation leading to mass-dependent isotopic fractionation. This process might explain the lighter calcium isotopic compositions observed in Group II REE pattern CAIs 27.

Finally, the **formation of CAIs in a heterogeneous nebula** is another possibility 9. If the early solar nebula had spatial variations in isotopic composition, CAIs forming in different regions or at different times could have inherited these heterogeneities. The internal 48Ca heterogeneity observed in some Type B CAIs might support this idea 9.

## **Comparison and Discussion**

The evidence supporting a direct and dominant role for sulfur-rich presolar grains in explaining the major isotopic anomalies in calcium and aluminum within Allende CAIs is currently limited. The primary isotopic signatures, such as the 48Ca excess and the presence of 26Al, have more established explanations related to nucleosynthetic inheritance and early solar system chronology. Mechanisms like incomplete homogenization of presolar material, irradiation, and evaporation/recondensation offer more direct explanations for these specific anomalies.

However, the potential for sulfur to play a more indirect or modulatory role cannot be entirely dismissed. Thermodynamic data indicate that sulfur can react with calcium and aluminum at high temperatures, suggesting a possible influence on the mineralogy of condensing refractory elements. Condensation models could be further refined to explore the effects of localized sulfur enrichments. High-precision isotopic measurements looking for correlations between sulfur abundance and specific isotopic anomalies in CAI minerals could provide further insights.

The occasional observation of CaS subgrains within presolar SiC suggests a direct link between sulfur-rich environments and presolar material incorporated into the early solar nebula. However, the generally low abundance of sulfur in mainstream presolar SiC might argue against a widespread influence on the condensation of major refractory elements. The behavior of sulfur as a refractory element at lower temperatures could also have implications for later stages of CAI formation.

## **Conclusion and Future Directions**

In summary, while sulfur is present in presolar grains and can chemically interact with calcium and aluminum at high temperatures relevant to the early solar nebula, the current evidence does not strongly support a primary role for sulfur-rich presolar grains in explaining the major isotopic heterogeneities observed in Allende CAIs. These anomalies are more likely attributed to the inheritance of nucleosynthetic products, the decay of short-lived radionuclides, and physical processes like evaporation and recondensation.

Nevertheless, sulfur might have played a more subtle role in influencing the local chemical environment during CAI formation, potentially affecting minor isotopic fractionation effects or the mineralogy under specific conditions. Future research should focus on detailed analyses of sulfur abundance and isotopic composition in various presolar grain types, refined thermodynamic modeling of condensation processes in the presence of sulfur, and high-resolution isotopic studies of individual CAI minerals to investigate potential correlations between sulfur and the isotopic signatures of calcium and aluminum. Exploring CAIs from a wider range of meteorites could also provide further constraints on the role of sulfur in early solar system processes.
