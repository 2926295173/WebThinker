# **Ontogenetic Shifts in Juvenile Lake Sturgeon Diet and Feeding Behavior in Response to Zebra Mussel Colonization in the Great Lakes**

**I. Introduction**

The Lake Sturgeon ( *Acipenser fulvescens* ) holds significant ecological importance within the Great Lakes ecosystem. As a long-lived species characterized by slow growth and late maturation, it exhibits a particular sensitivity to environmental perturbations 1. These attributes mean that any factors impacting their survival and development, especially during vulnerable juvenile stages, can have protracted consequences for population viability. Functioning as a key benthivore, the Lake Sturgeon plays a crucial role in the Great Lakes' benthic food web through its bottom-feeding activities, contributing to the cycling of nutrients within these aquatic environments 2. Furthermore, the health and abundance of Lake Sturgeon serve as a valuable indicator of the overall ecological integrity of the lakes and rivers they inhabit 3. Beyond their ecological role, Lake Sturgeon also hold cultural significance for numerous indigenous communities, inspiring various conservation and restoration initiatives 3.

The introduction of the Zebra Mussel (*Dreissena polymorpha*) in the late 1980s marked a dramatic shift in the ecological landscape of the Great Lakes 4. This highly invasive filter-feeding bivalve has since proliferated, reaching extraordinary densities in many areas and fundamentally altering the structure and function of these aquatic ecosystems 5. Their capacity to filter vast quantities of water has led to significant changes in water clarity and nutrient availability, triggering cascading effects throughout the food web. Notably, Zebra Mussels have had a profound impact on benthic invertebrate communities, which constitute a primary food source for a wide array of fish species, including the juvenile Lake Sturgeon 4. The magnitude of these ecosystem-level changes underscores the necessity of thoroughly investigating the specific ways in which Zebra Mussels are affecting endangered species like the Lake Sturgeon.

The juvenile life stage is a critical period for the recruitment and long-term sustainability of fish populations 9. Dietary shifts and alterations in feeding behavior during this phase can have substantial repercussions on an individual's growth trajectory, survival probability, and overall fitness. For an endangered species like the Lake Sturgeon, understanding these changes in the context of Zebra Mussel invasion is paramount for the development of targeted and effective conservation strategies. The dominance of Zebra Mussels in many benthic habitats necessitates a clear understanding of how they are influencing the fundamental ecological interactions of juvenile Lake Sturgeon, particularly their feeding ecology, to inform appropriate conservation actions.

**II. Historical Ecology of Juvenile Lake Sturgeon in the Great Lakes (Pre-Zebra Mussel Invasion)**

Prior to the widespread establishment of Zebra Mussels, juvenile Lake Sturgeon in the Great Lakes were primarily benthivores, relying on a diverse array of small, soft-bodied benthic invertebrates for sustenance 9. This consistent feeding habit across various studies conducted before the invasion highlights the fundamental importance of these organisms in the early life stages of the sturgeon. The diet typically included insect larvae, particularly chironomids (non-biting midges) and mayflies, alongside various worms, including leeches 1. Crustaceans such as crayfish and amphipods also formed a significant part of their diet, as did mollusks like snails and native clams 1. Notably, studies conducted in different regions within the Great Lakes basin revealed variations in the dominant prey items, reflecting the natural heterogeneity in local benthic community composition 12. For instance, in the Genesee River, Diptera (including Chironomidae) constituted the major prey biomass, while in the St. Regis River, Ephemeroptera (mayflies) and Diptera were key components 15. In another studied system, crayfish and snails were the predominant food sources 17. The presence of freshwater mussels in the historical diet 9 is noteworthy, especially considering the subsequent decline of native unionid populations following the Zebra Mussel invasion 18, suggesting a potential loss of a food resource.

Juvenile Lake Sturgeon employ a distinct feeding strategy adapted to their benthic lifestyle. They utilize their spade-like snout to probe and root within the substrate, stirring up potential prey 1. Sensory barbels located near their mouth play a crucial role in detecting the presence of food items in the sediment 1. Once prey is located, they extend their protrusible, sucker-like mouth to vacuum up the soft-bodied organisms, swallowing them whole due to their lack of teeth 1. This foraging method is particularly effective for capturing small, relatively immobile or burrowing invertebrates inhabiting soft sediments. Consequently, juvenile sturgeon typically forage in areas characterized by sandy, gravelly, or muddy bottoms where these invertebrate prey are abundant 9. Their habitat preferences further reflect this feeding ecology, with a tendency to inhabit areas with clean sand, gravel, or rock substrates 16. Shallow river mouths and bays often serve as important habitats for juveniles, particularly during the late summer months 14. This preference for specific substrate types makes juvenile sturgeon potentially vulnerable to habitat modifications resulting from Zebra Mussel colonization on these very substrates.

**III. Ecological Impacts of Zebra Mussel Invasion on Lake Sturgeon Habitats**

The invasion of Zebra Mussels has triggered significant alterations to the benthic environment of the Great Lakes. These highly adaptable bivalves can colonize a wide range of substrates, both hard and soft, forming dense, often multi-layered beds that dramatically change the physical structure of the lake and river bottoms 4. Previously open areas of sand or silt, which were preferred foraging grounds for juvenile Lake Sturgeon, can become carpeted with layers of living and dead Zebra Mussel shells, leading to a substantial increase in habitat complexity 21. This physical transformation of the lakebed represents a significant environmental change that can directly impact the foraging habitat of juvenile sturgeon, as their feeding adaptations are suited for smoother, less obstructed substrates.

Beyond the physical alteration of habitats, Zebra Mussels have exerted considerable influence on the composition and abundance of benthic invertebrate communities. As highly efficient filter feeders, they consume vast quantities of phytoplankton from the water column 5. This reduction in primary producers can have cascading effects on the food web, potentially limiting the resources available for other filter-feeding invertebrates and those that rely on them. While some studies have reported an initial increase in the abundance and diversity of certain benthic invertebrates in areas colonized by Zebra Mussels, possibly due to the increased habitat complexity and organic enrichment from mussel biodeposits 6, other research indicates negative impacts on specific prey taxa that are important for Lake Sturgeon 23. For instance, one study noted an increase in native gastropods following Zebra Mussel invasion but also the complete disappearance of native unionid mussels 18. Another study observed a decrease in the abundance of Trichoptera (caddisflies) after the invasion 23. Furthermore, the intricate structure of Zebra Mussel beds can create numerous small crevices and spaces that serve as refugia for macroinvertebrates, potentially making them less accessible to predators like juvenile Lake Sturgeon 20. This physical barrier could reduce the encounter rate between sturgeon and their prey, requiring them to expend more energy in searching. Additionally, Zebra Mussels compete directly with native benthic invertebrates for food resources by efficiently filtering phytoplankton, potentially further contributing to declines in their populations 5.

**IV. Shifts in Diet and Feeding Behavior of Juvenile Lake Sturgeon Post-Zebra Mussel Invasion**

Following the widespread colonization of the Great Lakes by Zebra Mussels, studies have documented shifts in the diet of juvenile Lake Sturgeon. Notably, larger juvenile sturgeon, typically exceeding 700 mm in length, have been observed to incorporate Zebra Mussels into their diet in various regions 3. For example, research conducted in Oneida Lake, New York, indicated that Zebra Mussels became a significant dietary component for juvenile Lake Sturgeon larger than 700 mm 12. Similarly, a diet study in the St. Clair River found Zebra Mussels to be the most abundant food item in the stomachs of Lake Sturgeon 20. This suggests an opportunistic feeding behavior in larger juveniles, allowing them to exploit a novel and abundant food source within their altered environment. The size-dependent nature of this dietary change points to an ontogenetic shift in feeding capability or preference, as smaller juveniles might lack the physical capacity to effectively consume or process the hard shells of Zebra Mussels.

The increased consumption of Zebra Mussels by larger juvenile Lake Sturgeon appears to be accompanied by a potential decrease in the consumption of their traditional benthic invertebrate prey 18. This shift could be a direct consequence of the altered benthic community structure, where Zebra Mussels have either displaced or reduced the populations of preferred prey items, forcing sturgeon to rely more heavily on the invasive species. For instance, a study on steelhead trout in a Lake Michigan tributary showed a diet shift from Trichoptera to Diptera and Amphipoda following Zebra Mussel invasion, indicating changes in prey availability 23.

Furthermore, the presence of dense Zebra Mussel beds seems to negatively impact the foraging behavior of juvenile Lake Sturgeon. Laboratory experiments have demonstrated that juvenile sturgeon exhibit reduced foraging success in habitats with high Zebra Mussel cover on sand or silt substrates 19. Foraging on relatively immobile prey like chironomids was particularly affected, with near elimination of successful foraging at high mussel densities 19. Additionally, juvenile sturgeon have been observed to actively avoid habitats heavily colonized by Zebra Mussels, indicating an alteration in their habitat selection and foraging strategies 19. This avoidance behavior might lead sturgeon to seek out alternative habitats, potentially those with less Zebra Mussel cover, such as deeper sections or areas with gravel substrates 26. While this avoidance could reduce direct negative interactions with Zebra Mussels, it might also result in increased competition for resources in these less preferred habitats or a reduction in overall foraging opportunities.

**V. Ontogenetic Dietary Shifts in Relation to Zebra Mussel Colonization**

Research indicates a clear ontogenetic dietary shift in Lake Sturgeon in response to Zebra Mussel colonization. Smaller juvenile Lake Sturgeon, typically those under 700 mm in total length, continue to primarily consume their traditional benthic invertebrate prey 12. In contrast, larger juveniles increasingly incorporate Zebra Mussels into their diet 12. This size-based shift likely reflects a developmental change in the sturgeon's ability to effectively process Zebra Mussels. Smaller juveniles may be limited by their gape size or the strength of their feeding apparatus, rendering them unable to crush or effectively ingest the hard-shelled mussels. As they grow, their physical capabilities likely improve, allowing them to handle this new prey source.

The continued reliance of the smallest juveniles on traditional benthic invertebrates in habitats now dominated by Zebra Mussels raises concerns about potential nutritional bottlenecks during these early life stages. If Zebra Mussels have indeed led to a decline in the abundance or availability of preferred prey for larval and very small juvenile sturgeon, this could significantly impact their growth and survival rates, ultimately affecting recruitment into the adult population. This dependence on potentially dwindling resources in altered environments underscores the vulnerability of young Lake Sturgeon in the face of the invasive species. Long-term monitoring of the diet and population dynamics of juvenile Lake Sturgeon is crucial to fully understand the long-term trends in their feeding ecology and to assess the potential for adaptation over successive generations in response to the persistent presence of Zebra Mussels.

**VI. Nutritional Consequences of Dietary Changes**

The shift towards incorporating Zebra Mussels into the diet of juvenile Lake Sturgeon raises important questions about the nutritional adequacy of this new food source compared to their traditional prey. Zebra Mussels are often considered a less nutritious food option for many fish species, sometimes referred to as "junk food" 20. Studies have shown that soft-bodied macroinvertebrates, such as *Diporeia*, a key prey item for many Great Lakes fish, possess a significantly higher energy density than Zebra Mussels, with one study reporting a four-fold difference 20. This lower nutritional value suggests that even when larger juvenile sturgeon consume Zebra Mussels, they might need to ingest a greater quantity to obtain a comparable energy intake to that from their traditional, more energy-rich prey. Furthermore, the hard, calcified shells of Zebra Mussels are likely difficult to digest and provide considerably less digestible energy compared to the soft tissues of invertebrates. The energy expenditure required to process these shells might further reduce the overall nutritional benefit derived from consuming Zebra Mussels.

A diet increasingly reliant on a less nutritious food source like Zebra Mussels could have negative consequences for the growth and survival of juvenile Lake Sturgeon. Reduced nutritional intake can lead to slower growth rates, potentially prolonging the period during which they are more vulnerable to predation and other environmental stressors 20. Lower body condition, resulting from a less energy-dense diet, could also negatively impact their overwinter survival and overall health 26. Additionally, Zebra Mussels have the capacity to bioaccumulate pollutants and toxins from the water column 22. Consequently, the consumption of large quantities of Zebra Mussels by Lake Sturgeon could potentially lead to the bioaccumulation of these contaminants in their tissues, with uncertain long-term effects on their health and reproductive success. The potential for biomagnification of toxins up the food chain to a long-lived, late-maturing species like the Lake Sturgeon is a significant concern.

**VII. Implications for Adaptive Management and Conservation Strategies**

The observed ontogenetic shifts in the diet and feeding behavior of juvenile Lake Sturgeon in response to Zebra Mussel colonization have significant implications for the conservation of this endangered species in the Great Lakes. Adaptive management strategies must consider these changes to ensure effective conservation outcomes.

Protecting and restoring Lake Sturgeon spawning and nursery habitats that are less prone to heavy Zebra Mussel colonization should be a priority 27. Areas with strong currents or specific substrate compositions might offer some refuge for juvenile sturgeon, allowing them continued access to their traditional prey. Exploring localized methods to mitigate Zebra Mussel impacts in critical juvenile sturgeon habitats could also be beneficial, although large-scale eradication in the Great Lakes is likely infeasible 28.

Given the potential nutritional limitations associated with a Zebra Mussel-dominated diet, stocking programs for juvenile Lake Sturgeon should consider the nutritional quality of the food provided in hatcheries 30. Ensuring that juveniles are well-nourished with a diet that mimics their historical prey could improve their overall health and resilience upon release into the wild 2. Furthermore, monitoring the growth and survival of stocked juveniles in areas with varying levels of Zebra Mussel colonization is crucial for assessing the effectiveness of stocking efforts and identifying specific challenges related to the invasive species.

Long-term monitoring programs are essential to continuously track the diet, growth rates, body condition, and survival of juvenile Lake Sturgeon across different regions of the Great Lakes with varying degrees of Zebra Mussel infestation 19. Further research is needed to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the nutritional value of Zebra Mussels for Lake Sturgeon at different life stages and to investigate the potential for bioaccumulation of contaminants 19. Additionally, research should focus on the long-term impacts of Zebra Mussel-induced dietary shifts on the reproductive success and overall population health of Lake Sturgeon 19.

Adopting an adaptive management framework is crucial, allowing for flexibility in conservation strategies based on the findings of ongoing monitoring and research 28. This includes regularly evaluating the effectiveness of current management actions and making necessary adjustments as new information becomes available. Collaboration among various agencies, researchers, and stakeholders is also vital for sharing information and coordinating conservation efforts for Lake Sturgeon throughout the Great Lakes 28. Finally, public education and outreach initiatives are important for raising awareness about the threats facing Lake Sturgeon, including the impacts of invasive species like Zebra Mussels, and for educating anglers and boaters on how to prevent the further spread of these harmful organisms 22.

**VIII. Conclusion**

The colonization of the Great Lakes by Zebra Mussels has demonstrably influenced the diet and feeding behavior of juvenile Lake Sturgeon. Larger juveniles have shown a shift towards incorporating Zebra Mussels into their diet, likely driven by the abundance of this invasive species and a potential decline in the availability of their traditional benthic invertebrate prey. This dietary shift, however, carries potential nutritional consequences, as Zebra Mussels appear to be a less energy-dense food source compared to the historical diet of juvenile sturgeon. Furthermore, the physical presence of dense Zebra Mussel beds negatively impacts the foraging efficiency of juvenile sturgeon on soft substrates, and they tend to avoid heavily colonized areas. These changes have significant implications for the conservation of this endangered species, potentially affecting their growth rates, survival, and overall health. Therefore, continued research and the implementation of adaptive management strategies that consider these ecological shifts are essential to ensure the long-term recovery and persistence of Lake Sturgeon populations in the Great Lakes.
