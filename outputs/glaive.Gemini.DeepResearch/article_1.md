# **Dietary Omega-6 to Omega-3 Fatty Acid Ratio and Advanced Glycosylation End-Products: Influences on Pancreatic Beta-Cell Function and Insulin Sensitivity in Impaired Glucose Tolerance**

**1\. Introduction**

Impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) represents an intermediate state of hyperglycemia, wherein blood glucose levels are elevated above normal but not yet high enough to be classified as type 2 diabetes (T2DM). This condition is often viewed as a critical window for intervention to prevent the progression to overt diabetes 1. Pancreatic beta-cells play a pivotal role in glucose homeostasis by producing and secreting insulin, a hormone essential for facilitating the uptake of glucose from the bloodstream into cells for energy utilization or storage. Insulin sensitivity, conversely, refers to the capacity of cells to respond effectively to insulin's signal to absorb glucose. Disruptions in either beta-cell function or insulin sensitivity can lead to or exacerbate glucose intolerance.

Omega-6 and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are essential dietary fats that cannot be synthesized by the human body and must be obtained through diet 2. These fatty acids are distinguished by the location of their first double bond in their chemical structure and exert distinct physiological effects 2. Advanced glycosylation end-products (AGEs) are a heterogeneous group of compounds formed through a non-enzymatic reaction between sugars and proteins or lipids, a process known as glycation or the Maillard reaction 4. AGEs can be formed endogenously, particularly under conditions of hyperglycemia, and are also present in the diet, especially in foods cooked at high temperatures 4. Dietary interventions focusing on the balance of omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids and the limitation of AGE intake are increasingly recognized as important strategies in managing metabolic health and potentially mitigating the progression of IGT to T2DM.

**2\. The Role of Omega-6 and Omega-3 Fatty Acids in Glucose Metabolism**

**2.1. Distinct Metabolic Roles and Eicosanoid Production**

Omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids serve as precursors to different classes of eicosanoids, signaling molecules that play crucial roles in regulating inflammation, thrombosis, and other physiological processes 2. Linoleic acid (LA), the primary omega-6 PUFA in Western diets, can be metabolized to arachidonic acid (AA), which is a precursor to pro-inflammatory eicosanoids such as prostaglandin E2 and leukotriene B4 2. In contrast, alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), an omega-3 PUFA, can be converted to eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), which give rise to eicosanoids with generally anti-inflammatory effects, such as prostaglandin E3 and leukotriene B5, as well as resolvins, maresins, and protectins 2. The conversion of ALA to EPA and DHA is often inefficient, particularly in men, and is further reduced by a high intake of LA due to competition for the same desaturation enzymes, namely Δ5 and Δ6 desaturase (also known as Fatty Acid Desaturase 1 and 2, FADS1 and FADS2) 2. This competition underscores the importance of the dietary ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids in influencing the balance of these eicosanoids and, consequently, the overall inflammatory status of the body. The balance between omega-6 and omega-3 intake directly influences the production of inflammatory mediators, which are known to significantly affect insulin resistance and beta-cell function. Eicosanoids derived from AA tend to be pro-inflammatory, while those from EPA and DHA are generally anti-inflammatory. The ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 intake dictates the substrate availability for these pathways, thus impacting the overall inflammatory tone.

**2.2. Impact on Pancreatic Beta-Cell Function in the Context of Chronic Hypoglycemia**

Research suggests that a high omega-6 to omega-3 ratio can negatively impact pancreatic beta-cell function. Studies involving obese adolescents with metabolic syndrome, characterized by high levels of free fatty acids (FFAs) and a high polyunsaturated omega-6/omega-3 ratio in plasma, demonstrated a toxic effect on beta-cell viability and function. This was associated with increased oxidative stress and decreased glucose-dependent insulin secretion 7. Conversely, a lower ratio, indicative of higher omega-3 intake, has been suggested to be beneficial for beta-cell health. The ratio of arachidonic acid (AA) to eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), both long-chain PUFAs, has been examined in relation to beta-cell function and the progression of type 1 diabetes, with some experts recommending a ratio below 3 to potentially prevent disease progression 8. However, findings regarding the impact of omega-3 supplementation on glucose metabolism and beta-cell function are not entirely consistent. Some experimental investigations have reported significant increases in fasting glucose following omega-3 fatty acid supplementation, raising concerns about their impact on diabetes management 6. Furthermore, enrichment of a high-saturated fat diet with long-chain omega-3 fatty acids has been observed to suppress the insulin response to glucose in isolated islets, suggesting a direct effect on islet function 9. These observations indicate that the effect of omega-3 fatty acids on beta-cell function is complex and may depend on factors such as the overall dietary context, the specific type and dose of omega-3 fatty acids, and the individual's metabolic status. The effect of omega-3 on beta-cell function appears complex and potentially dose-dependent or context-specific (e.g., presence of high saturated fat, specific metabolic state). Some studies show benefits of omega-3 for beta-cells, likely through anti-inflammatory mechanisms, while others suggest potential impairment of insulin secretion, possibly through direct effects on islet function or altered glucose metabolism.

**2.3. Effects on Insulin Sensitivity in Individuals with Impaired Glucose Tolerance**

The dietary ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids also plays a significant role in modulating insulin sensitivity, particularly in individuals with impaired glucose tolerance. A higher ratio of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) to arachidonic acid (AA) has been identified as a promising indicator of improved glycemic control and reduced inflammation, suggesting that a relative increase in omega-3 intake may enhance insulin sensitivity 2. Studies have indicated that omega-3 fatty acids are more effective than omega-6 fatty acids in improving glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity 10. Elevated ratios of saturated fatty acids (SFAs) to polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in skeletal muscle cell membranes have been associated with decreased glucose effectiveness and insulin sensitivity, potentially increasing the risk of developing T2DM 11. The modern Western diet, characterized by a high intake of omega-6 fatty acids and a low intake of omega-3 fatty acids, resulting in an unhealthy omega-6/omega-3 ratio, has been implicated in the development of insulin resistance and increased prevalence of diabetes 2. Research has shown that individuals with type 2 diabetes tend to have a higher omega-6/omega-3 ratio compared to non-diabetic individuals, further supporting the link between this ratio and impaired glucose tolerance 16. Maintaining a lower omega-6/omega-3 ratio, favoring omega-3 intake, is generally associated with improved insulin sensitivity in individuals with or at risk of impaired glucose tolerance. Omega-3 fatty acids have anti-inflammatory properties and can influence cell membrane composition and signaling pathways involved in insulin action, leading to enhanced glucose uptake.

**3\. The Impact of Dietary Advanced Glycosylation End-Products (AGEs) on Insulin Sensitivity and Beta-Cell Function**

**3.1. Formation and Sources of Dietary AGEs**

Dietary advanced glycosylation end-products (AGEs) are formed in foods through the Maillard reaction, a non-enzymatic browning process that occurs when reducing sugars react with amino groups of proteins, lipids, or nucleic acids 4. This reaction is accelerated by high temperatures, dry cooking methods such as roasting, grilling, and frying, as well as prolonged cooking times 4. Consequently, animal-derived foods cooked under these conditions tend to have the highest content of AGEs 5. Pre-packaged and fast foods also often contain high levels of AGEs due to the processing and cooking methods involved 4. Additionally, tobacco smoking is a significant environmental source of AGE exposure 4.

**3.2. Mechanisms of AGE-Induced Insulin Resistance**

Once ingested, approximately 10% of dietary AGEs are absorbed into the circulation and contribute to the body's overall AGE pool 4. These exogenous AGEs can impair insulin signaling in various insulin-sensitive tissues, including adipose tissue and skeletal muscle 4. In vitro studies have shown that incubation of adipocytes with AGEs prevents their differentiation, decreases glucose uptake activity, and increases the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) 5. This AGE-induced perturbation of glucose uptake appears to be mediated by the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) and the generation of intracellular oxidative stress 5. Furthermore, AGEs can increase the expression of inflammatory markers such as Monocyte Chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), which is involved in adipose tissue macrophage infiltration and insulin resistance 5. Research has consistently linked dietary AGE intake with the development of insulin resistance in vitro, in animal models, and in human studies 17. AGEs can lead to a decrease in insulin receptor and insulin-receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) phosphorylation levels, consequently impairing glucose uptake via the activation of Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) 4. The receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) plays a crucial role in mediating the inflammatory pathways and oxidative stress induced by AGE binding, further contributing to insulin resistance 5. Dietary AGEs contribute to insulin resistance by directly interfering with insulin signaling pathways and by promoting inflammation and oxidative stress, both of which impair insulin action. AGEs can bind to RAGE, triggering downstream signaling pathways that lead to the production of inflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species. These factors disrupt the normal functioning of insulin receptors and downstream signaling molecules, reducing glucose uptake.

**3.3. Mechanisms of AGE-Induced Impairment of Pancreatic Beta-Cell Function**

Dietary AGEs can also directly affect pancreatic beta-cells, leading to their dysfunction and reduced insulin secretion 4. In vitro studies with insulin-secreting cell lines have shown that AGEs can enhance cell apoptosis and inhibit insulin secretion 5. It has also been suggested that AGEs might bind to insulin and decrease its biological activity 5. The apoptotic effects of AGEs have been shown to be mediated via mitochondrial electron transport chain inhibition and an increase in ROS production 5. Research in mice has demonstrated that treatment with AGEs impairs glucose-stimulated insulin secretion by inducing the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), which subsequently inhibits cytochrome c oxidase and ATP synthesis through nitric oxide production 19. Studies using aminoguanidine, an inhibitor of AGE formation, have shown protection of islet beta-cell function in animal models and isolated islets 4. These findings suggest that dietary AGEs can directly impair the ability of pancreatic beta-cells to secrete insulin in response to glucose, potentially contributing to the progression of impaired glucose tolerance to diabetes. AGEs can interfere with the cellular machinery of beta-cells, affecting key processes like ATP production and insulin granule release. This can lead to a reduced capacity of the beta-cells to compensate for insulin resistance by increasing insulin secretion.

**4\. Combined Effects of Omega-6/Omega-3 Ratio and Dietary AGEs on Insulin Sensitivity**

Limited research directly examines the combined effects of the omega-6/omega-3 ratio and dietary AGEs on insulin sensitivity. However, evidence suggests that a high omega-6/omega-3 ratio is associated with increased risk of obesity and inflammation 2, both of which are established risk factors for insulin resistance 13. Conversely, supplementation with omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, with a greater prevalence of omega-3, appears to regulate metabolic changes that lead to obesity and high blood pressure 21. Omega-6 fatty acids, particularly linoleic acid, can be metabolized to arachidonic acid, a precursor to pro-inflammatory mediators that can contribute to insulin resistance 13. In contrast, omega-3 fatty acids possess anti-inflammatory and insulin-sensitizing properties 10. It is plausible that a diet high in both omega-6 fatty acids and AGEs could have a synergistic negative impact on insulin sensitivity. The pro-inflammatory environment fostered by a high omega-6/omega-3 ratio might exacerbate the detrimental effects of dietary AGEs, which also promote inflammation and oxidative stress through RAGE activation 5. This combined inflammatory burden could further impair insulin signaling and reduce glucose uptake. Conversely, a lower omega-6/omega-3 ratio, favoring omega-3 intake, might offer some protective effect against AGE-induced insulin resistance due to the anti-inflammatory properties of omega-3 fatty acids, potentially counteracting the inflammatory pathways activated by AGEs 13. A diet high in both omega-6 and AGEs could create a "double hit" on insulin sensitivity by promoting both systemic inflammation (via omega-6) and direct impairment of insulin signaling and increased oxidative stress (via AGEs). Both high omega-6 intake (leading to pro-inflammatory eicosanoids) and high AGE intake (activating inflammatory pathways via RAGE) contribute to a pro-inflammatory state. This chronic inflammation is a key driver of insulin resistance, suggesting a potential synergistic effect when both factors are elevated. Increasing omega-3 intake might offer some protection against AGE-induced insulin resistance by counteracting the inflammatory pathways activated by AGEs. Omega-3 fatty acids and their metabolites have been shown to have anti-inflammatory effects, potentially by modulating the same pathways that are upregulated by AGEs (e.g., NF-kB). This suggests that a higher omega-3 intake could help to balance the inflammatory response triggered by AGE consumption.

**5\. Optimal Omega-6 to Omega-3 Ratio for Mitigating the Deleterious Effects of Chronic Hypoglycemia on Beta-Cell Function in the Presence of Dietary AGEs**

Determining the optimal omega-6 to omega-3 ratio for mitigating the negative effects of chronic hypoglycemia on beta-cell function in the presence of dietary AGEs is a complex challenge, and specific research directly addressing this multifaceted question is currently lacking. General recommendations for a healthy omega-6 to omega-3 ratio typically range from 1:1 to 4:1 22, which is significantly lower than the ratio observed in typical Western diets, often ranging from 15:1 to 20:1 or even higher 2. Studies have shown that lower omega-6/omega-3 ratios are associated with benefits in various health conditions, including a 70% decrease in total mortality in the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease with a ratio of 4:1, and suppressed inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis patients with a ratio of 2-3:1 22. For preventing type 1 diabetes progression, some experts recommend an AA:EPA ratio below 3, implying a higher omega-3 intake 8. Given the pro-inflammatory nature of both a high omega-6/omega-3 ratio and dietary AGEs, a lower ratio favoring omega-3 fatty acids is likely to be more beneficial in mitigating their combined deleterious effects on beta-cell function in the context of chronic hypoglycemia. The rationale for this lies in the potential of omega-3 fatty acids to counteract inflammation and oxidative stress, which are implicated in both beta-cell dysfunction and the adverse effects of AGEs. However, it is important to acknowledge that current research has not established a precise optimal ratio for this specific scenario, and further investigation is needed to define targeted dietary recommendations 24. Given the pro-inflammatory nature of both high omega-6/omega-3 ratios and dietary AGEs, a lower ratio favoring omega-3 is likely to be more beneficial for mitigating their combined deleterious effects on beta-cell function in the context of chronic hypoglycemia. Chronic low-grade inflammation and oxidative stress are key factors in the pathogenesis of both insulin resistance and beta-cell dysfunction. By reducing the omega-6/omega-3 ratio, the overall inflammatory burden can be lessened, potentially protecting beta-cells from further damage exacerbated by AGEs. While general dietary guidelines emphasize a lower omega-6/omega-3 ratio and reduced AGE intake for overall health, specific recommendations tailored to individuals with impaired glucose tolerance and considering the combined effects are lacking. The complex interactions between these dietary factors and individual metabolic responses necessitate more targeted research before specific, evidence-based guidelines can be established for this population.

**6\. Mechanisms of Interaction**

The interaction between omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids and AGEs likely involves a complex interplay of several biochemical and physiological mechanisms. The balance of dietary omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids significantly influences the production of eicosanoids, with omega-6 derived eicosanoids generally promoting inflammation and omega-3 derived eicosanoids having anti-inflammatory effects 2. This balance is critical because both high omega-6 intake (via arachidonic acid) and AGEs can activate the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kB) pathway, a key regulator of inflammation, leading to increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) 5. Omega-3 fatty acids, particularly EPA and DHA, can inhibit the NF-kB pathway, potentially counteracting the inflammatory effects of both omega-6 and AGEs 13. Oxidative stress is another crucial factor, as it is increased by both a high omega-6/omega-3 ratio (through pro-inflammatory eicosanoids) and AGEs (via RAGE activation and mitochondrial dysfunction) 5. Omega-3 fatty acids have been shown to improve mitochondrial function and beta-oxidation, which may help to mitigate some of the metabolic stress induced by these factors 13. Furthermore, both omega-6 and omega-3 PUFAs are important structural components of cell membranes, affecting their fluidity and the activity of membrane-bound enzymes and cell-signaling pathways 3. High levels of free fatty acids, particularly in the context of a high omega-6/omega-3 ratio, can exert lipotoxicity on pancreatic beta-cells, impairing insulin secretion 7. AGEs can also directly impair beta-cell function by inhibiting ATP production and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion 19. The interaction likely involves a complex interplay of inflammatory signaling pathways, oxidative stress, and alterations in cellular metabolism. Both omega-6 and AGEs tend to promote pro-inflammatory and pro-oxidative states, while omega-3s generally exert opposing effects. At the molecular level, both high omega-6 and AGEs converge on pathways like NF-kB, amplifying inflammation. Simultaneously, both can contribute to oxidative stress, damaging cellular components. Omega-3s, by modulating these same pathways and potentially improving antioxidant defense, can offer a counter-regulatory effect.

**Table 2: Mechanisms of Interaction Between Omega-6/Omega-3 Fatty Acids and AGEs on Insulin Sensitivity and Beta-Cell Function**

| Dietary Factor(s) | Mechanism of Action | Effect on Insulin Sensitivity | Effect on Beta-Cell Function | Supporting Snippet(s) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| High Omega-6 intake | Increased production of pro-inflammatory eicosanoids (e.g., from AA) | Decrease | Potential impairment | 2, 13 |

| Omega-3s & AGEs | Omega-3s may counteract AGE-induced inflammation | Potential mitigation | Potential protection | 13 |

**7\. Expert Reviews and Meta-Analyses**

Expert reviews and meta-analyses provide a broader perspective on the effects of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids on glucose metabolism. An updated review highlights the imbalance between omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids in modern diets and their potential impact on glucose metabolism 13. Some meta-analyses suggest that omega-3 supplementation can improve glycemic factors in patients with T2DM 26. However, others indicate that increasing omega-3, omega-6, or total PUFA intake may have little or no effect on the prevention and treatment of T2DM, and high doses of omega-3 might even worsen glucose metabolism in some individuals 6. Notably, one meta-analysis found that plant-derived omega-6 PUFA might have a protective effect on diabetes risk 29. The inconsistencies in these findings may be attributed to various factors, including the source and dose of omega-3 fatty acids, the study population's characteristics (e.g., health status, ethnicity), the duration of the intervention, and even the cooking methods used for food preparation 2. The complex interplay between genes and environmental factors, including diet, in the pathogenesis of T2DM is also acknowledged 30. The evidence from reviews and meta-analyses regarding the effects of omega-3 and omega-6 on glucose metabolism is not entirely consistent, suggesting that the context (e.g., health status, baseline diet, type and dose of fatty acids) is crucial. Different meta-analyses may include studies with varying methodologies, populations, and interventions, leading to heterogeneity in the results. This highlights the need for more targeted research focusing on specific subgroups and dietary contexts.

**8\. Dietary Recommendations and Guidelines**

Current dietary recommendations generally emphasize the importance of achieving a balanced intake of omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids. The American Heart Association (AHA) recommends consuming at least two portions of fish per week, particularly oily fish rich in omega-3 fatty acids, and suggests a healthy omega-6 to omega-3 ratio between 1:1 and 4:1 23. However, typical Western diets often have a much higher ratio, around 15:1 to 17:1 2. Adequate intake levels for ALA (omega-3) are around 1.1-1.6 grams per day for adults, and for LA (omega-6) are around 12-17 grams per day for adults aged 19-50 years 23. Replacing saturated fats with omega-6 PUFAs can lower total blood cholesterol, but this may not necessarily translate to cardiovascular benefits in individuals with or at risk of T2DM 3. Recommendations for limiting dietary AGEs include favoring cooking methods that use lower heat and higher humidity, such as stewing and poaching, over dry, high-heat methods like roasting, grilling, and frying. Limiting the consumption of processed and fast foods is also advised 4. It is important to note that specific guidelines for the optimal omega-6/omega-3 ratio in individuals with IGT and chronic hypoglycemia, especially in the presence of high dietary AGEs, are not yet well-established. While general dietary guidelines emphasize a lower omega-6/omega-3 ratio and reduced AGE intake for overall health, specific recommendations tailored to individuals with impaired glucose tolerance and considering the combined effects are lacking. The complex interactions between these dietary factors and individual metabolic responses necessitate more targeted research before specific, evidence-based guidelines can be established for this population.

**9\. Conclusion**

The relationship between dietary omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acid ratio, advanced glycosylation end-products (AGEs), pancreatic beta-cell function, and insulin sensitivity in individuals with impaired glucose tolerance is complex and not fully elucidated. While a lower omega-6/omega-3 ratio, favoring omega-3 intake, is generally associated with improved insulin sensitivity and reduced inflammation, which could be beneficial for individuals with IGT, the optimal ratio for mitigating the specific deleterious effects of chronic hypoglycemia on beta-cell function in the presence of dietary AGEs remains unclear. Evidence indicates that dietary AGEs contribute to both insulin resistance and beta-cell dysfunction through inflammatory and oxidative stress pathways, and a high omega-6/omega-3 ratio may potentially exacerbate these negative effects. Current dietary guidelines emphasize a balanced intake of omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids and the limitation of AGE intake. However, specific recommendations tailored to individuals with IGT and considering the combined impact of these dietary factors are lacking. Further research, particularly well-designed human intervention trials that control for both omega-6/omega-3 ratio and dietary AGE intake, is needed to establish more precise dietary recommendations for this population and to better understand the intricate mechanisms of interaction between these dietary components and glucose metabolism.
