# **Effective Sampling Strategy for Detecting Norovirus and Rotavirus in Treated Wastewater Effluent**

**1\. Introduction**

Waterborne gastroenteritis poses a significant public health burden, particularly in rural communities where access to improved sanitation and healthcare infrastructure may be limited 1. Norovirus and rotavirus are recognized as the leading viral pathogens responsible for causing acute gastroenteritis worldwide, affecting individuals of all ages 1. The impact of these infections can range from mild, self-limiting illness to severe dehydration requiring hospitalization, especially in vulnerable populations such as young children and the elderly 1. Given the potential for widespread transmission through contaminated water sources, effective surveillance strategies are crucial for protecting public health in these communities.

Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) has emerged as a valuable tool for monitoring the prevalence of pathogens in communities by analyzing their presence in sewage systems 5. This approach offers several advantages, including the ability to detect pathogens shed by both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals, providing a more comprehensive understanding of community-level infection dynamics 6. WBE can also serve as an early warning system for potential outbreaks, allowing public health officials to implement timely interventions to prevent further spread of disease 6. In communities with a high incidence of waterborne gastroenteritis, such as the rural community in question, wastewater surveillance for key etiological agents like norovirus and rotavirus becomes particularly important for informing targeted public health interventions and mitigating the disease burden 5.

Detecting norovirus and rotavirus in treated wastewater effluent presents unique challenges. While wastewater treatment processes aim to remove or inactivate pathogens, the effectiveness against viruses can vary, and low concentrations of these viruses may still be present in the final effluent 8. Furthermore, the shedding of norovirus and rotavirus by infected individuals is known to be highly variable in terms of both the peak viral load and the duration of shedding 10. This variability, coupled with the potential for intermittent shedding, can make it difficult to consistently detect these viruses in wastewater samples. To address these challenges, it is essential to develop a sampling strategy that maximizes the likelihood of detection while also providing sufficient statistical power to draw meaningful conclusions and inform effective public health actions. This report aims to recommend the most effective sampling strategy for detecting norovirus and rotavirus in the treated wastewater effluent of a small-scale treatment plant serving a rural community with a high incidence of waterborne gastroenteritis, considering these complexities.

**2\. Characteristics of Norovirus and Rotavirus**

Understanding the shedding patterns of norovirus and rotavirus in human populations is fundamental to designing an effective wastewater sampling strategy. Studies have shown that norovirus shedding is characterized by significant variability. Peak concentrations in stool samples can range from 10^5 to 10^9 genome copies per gram of feces, and the duration of shedding can vary considerably, from 8 to 60 days 10. Notably, individuals can shed norovirus even before the onset of symptoms, during the incubation period of 12-48 hours, and shedding can persist for weeks to months after the resolution of symptoms 13. Asymptomatic infections also occur, with shedding patterns similar to those observed in symptomatic cases 10. Furthermore, norovirus infections tend to exhibit seasonal trends, with higher rates typically observed during the colder months of the year 3.

Rotavirus shedding also presents with variability, although some differences exist compared to norovirus. The median duration of shedding has been reported to be longer in children with symptomatic rotavirus infection (24 days) compared to those with asymptomatic infections (18 days) 4. Similar to norovirus, rotavirus shedding can begin before the appearance of symptoms and can continue for an extended period, up to 57 days in some cases 4. Shedding of the vaccine virus can also occur following rotavirus vaccination, with peak excretion typically around day 7 after the first dose 15. Factors such as age, immune status, the severity of the infection, and vaccination status can influence the duration and magnitude of viral shedding for both norovirus and rotavirus 2. The prolonged and variable nature of shedding, including the occurrence of asymptomatic shedding, suggests that the presence of these viruses in wastewater effluent may be intermittent and at varying concentrations over time 4.

Both norovirus and rotavirus are known to be present in wastewater and can persist in aquatic environments for considerable periods 1. Rotavirus has been shown to survive in freshwater sources for approximately 10 days at 20 °C and up to 32 days at 4 °C 1. In treated tap water, rotavirus has been found to persist for even longer durations, with a titer decrease of only about 2 log10 over 64 days at 20 °C 1. Norovirus is also environmentally robust, capable of surviving for weeks on surfaces and potentially months in contaminated water 20. These viruses may also exhibit resistance to conventional water disinfection treatments 1. The primary method for detecting norovirus and rotavirus in wastewater is through molecular techniques, particularly polymerase chain reaction (PCR) 5. More advanced methods like digital PCR (dPCR) offer enhanced sensitivity and the ability for absolute quantification, which can be advantageous for detecting low viral loads 5. The persistence of norovirus and rotavirus in treated wastewater, coupled with their potential resistance to disinfection, highlights the importance of monitoring the treated effluent to evaluate the effectiveness of the treatment process and to assess any potential risks to public health 1.

**3\. Wastewater Treatment and Viral Load in Treated Effluent**

Small-scale wastewater treatment plants typically employ conventional treatment processes such as activated sludge, trickling filters, or oxidation ponds to remove contaminants from wastewater 22. These biological treatment methods rely on microorganisms to break down organic matter and reduce the levels of pollutants 23. While these processes are generally effective in removing many types of contaminants, their efficiency in removing or inactivating viruses, particularly norovirus and rotavirus, can vary 22. Some research suggests that smaller wastewater treatment plants might have different removal efficiencies for certain contaminants compared to larger facilities 25. Log reductions of enteric viruses, including norovirus and rotavirus, in conventional wastewater treatment processes have been reported to range from 1 to 4 log10 9. Membrane bioreactor (MBR) systems, which combine biological treatment with membrane filtration, have demonstrated higher removal rates for viruses in some studies, even achieving 100% removal for certain enteric viruses 8. However, the specific treatment technologies and operational parameters of the small-scale plant serving the rural community will ultimately determine its viral removal efficiency. The variability in treatment effectiveness, especially in smaller plants, makes it plausible for viral breakthrough to occur in the treated effluent, underscoring the need for direct monitoring to quantify the actual viral load discharged into the environment 8.

Concentrations of norovirus and rotavirus in untreated influent wastewater can be substantial, ranging from 10^3 to 10^6 genome copies per liter for rotavirus and potentially higher for norovirus 3. Following treatment, these concentrations are expected to be reduced, but detectable levels may still persist in the treated effluent 8. For instance, one study reported rotavirus concentrations in the final effluent of wastewater treatment plants ranging from 3.35 to 3.61 log10 genome equivalent copies per liter 29. Another study detected norovirus in 8% of final effluent samples 19. Maximum effluent breakthrough concentrations for norovirus have been reported as high as 3 x 10^6 genome copies per liter 8. These findings indicate that while treatment processes do reduce the viral load, norovirus and rotavirus can still be present in the treated effluent, often at low concentrations 8. The potential for these low concentrations in the treated effluent, coupled with the variability in shedding patterns, necessitates the use of sensitive detection methods and potentially larger sample volumes to ensure reliable detection through wastewater surveillance 8.

**4\. Sampling Strategies for Viral Detection in Treated Effluent**

When designing a wastewater sampling strategy for detecting norovirus and rotavirus in treated effluent, it is crucial to consider the advantages and disadvantages of different sampling methods, primarily grab sampling and composite sampling. Grab sampling involves collecting a single sample at a specific point in time 5. This method is rapid and does not require automated equipment, making it convenient for quick assessments 30. However, a grab sample provides only a snapshot of the wastewater composition at that particular moment and may not be representative of the overall viral load, especially considering the daily fluctuations in wastewater flow and the intermittent nature of viral shedding 30. The timing of a grab sample can also significantly influence the detection of viruses 31. While grab sampling might be sufficient in situations where the prevalence of infection in the community is very high, its limited representativeness makes it less ideal for detecting potentially low and variable concentrations of norovirus and rotavirus in treated effluent 30.

In contrast, composite sampling involves collecting multiple samples, or aliquots, over a specified period, typically 24 hours, and then pooling them together to form a single, representative sample 5. This method is generally considered more representative of the community's fecal contributions over time as it averages out the fluctuations in viral shedding and wastewater flow that can occur throughout the day 5. Composite samples can be collected manually or using automated samplers equipped with refrigeration to preserve the samples during the collection period 30. Some public health agencies, such as the New Jersey Public Health and Environmental Laboratories (PHEL), prefer composite samples for wastewater testing due to their ability to provide an unbiased sample over a longer duration 5. Continuous composite samplers, which collect small samples at regular intervals, may offer even better representativeness compared to flow-weighted composite samplers 30. For detecting intermittent viral contamination in treated effluent, composite sampling over a 24-hour period is likely more effective than a single grab sample because it increases the probability of capturing viral shedding events that might be missed by a single point-in-time collection 5. Given the characteristics of norovirus and rotavirus shedding and the potential for low concentrations in treated effluent, the benefit of capturing a broader temporal window with composite sampling outweighs the convenience of grab sampling for this specific scenario 5.

**Table 1: Pros and Cons of Grab vs. Composite Sampling for Norovirus and Rotavirus Detection in Treated Effluent**

| Feature | Grab Sampling | Composite Sampling | Suitability for Norovirus/Rotavirus in Treated Effluent |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Representativeness | Snapshot of a single point in time | More representative of average viral load over a period | Less suitable due to shedding variability and low levels |
| Cost/Equipment | Lower cost, no automated equipment needed | Higher cost for automated samplers (optional) |  |
| Labor | Less labor for individual collection | More labor for setup/retrieval of composite samples |  |
| Detection of Intermittent Contamination | Lower probability of detection | Higher probability of detection due to larger volume/timeframe | More suitable for capturing variable shedding |
| Sample Volume | Typically smaller volume | Larger total volume | Advantageous for detecting low concentrations |

**5\. Optimizing Sampling Frequency and Duration**

The frequency at which wastewater samples are collected plays a crucial role in the probability of detecting intermittent viral shedding events. More frequent sampling increases the likelihood of capturing periods when norovirus and rotavirus are present in the treated effluent 6. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Wastewater Surveillance System (NWSS) recommends wastewater testing twice per week at each sampling site across the United States 6. This recommendation, while primarily focused on SARS-CoV-2 surveillance, underscores the general principle that regular and frequent sampling is important for effective wastewater monitoring of viral pathogens. Several studies have employed different sampling frequencies for monitoring enteric viruses in wastewater. For example, one study monitored rotavirus, adenovirus, enterovirus, and norovirus twice per week for 26 weeks 3. Another study analyzed wastewater samples for norovirus collected fortnightly from sewage treatment plants 21. A systematic review and meta-analysis of norovirus wastewater surveillance studies included studies that performed continuous sampling for at least three months 35. Weekly sampling has also been used in various studies to monitor enteric viruses in wastewater 36. Given the potential for rapid changes in viral load and the high incidence of gastroenteritis in the community, a sampling frequency of at least twice per week is advisable to balance resource constraints with the desired level of detection sensitivity 3.

The duration of composite sampling is also an important consideration. A 24-hour composite sample is a common standard in wastewater surveillance as it is designed to capture the diurnal variations in wastewater flow and the excretion of pathogens that occur due to changes in human activity patterns throughout the day 5. By collecting samples over a 24-hour period and pooling them, this approach helps to average out short-term fluctuations in viral concentration, providing a more representative measure of the average daily viral load in the treated effluent 32. A 24-hour composite sampling duration is therefore appropriate for this context as it accounts for variations in human activity and potential intermittent shedding that might occur at different times of the day 5.

Seasonal trends in the prevalence of norovirus infections, with peaks typically occurring in the winter and spring months, should also be taken into account when optimizing the sampling strategy 3. During these peak seasons, the risk of outbreaks is higher, and the viral load in the community's wastewater is likely to be greater. To enhance early detection capabilities during these periods of increased risk, it might be prudent to consider increasing the sampling frequency beyond the baseline of twice per week 3.

**Table 2: Sampling Frequencies and Detection Rates of Norovirus and Rotavirus in Wastewater from Selected Studies**

| Mahdi et al29. | Multiple times | Rotavirus | 100% | 100% | Influent and effluent of three WWTPs |

**6\. Statistical Power and Sample Volume Determination**

Achieving sufficient statistical power is essential for a wastewater surveillance program to reliably detect the presence or absence of target viruses and to identify meaningful changes in their levels over time 41. Adequate statistical power ensures that the conclusions drawn from the monitoring data are likely to be real and not simply due to random variation, which is crucial for informing public health decisions and evaluating the effectiveness of any interventions implemented 41. Several factors can influence the statistical power of a wastewater surveillance program, including the prevalence of the viruses in the community, the variability in viral shedding, the sensitivity of the detection method used, the sample volume collected, and the frequency and duration of sampling.

To enhance the probability of detecting potentially low concentrations of norovirus and rotavirus in treated effluent, collecting a sufficiently large sample volume is generally recommended 1. A larger sample volume increases the number of viral particles that can be captured, thereby improving the chances of detection, especially when the viruses are present at or near the detection limit of the analytical method. Given the likelihood of low viral loads in treated effluent, a sample volume of at least 1 liter is advisable for each composite sample. Processing such a volume often necessitates the use of a virus concentration method to reduce the sample volume and concentrate the viral particles prior to nucleic acid extraction and analysis 44. Various concentration methods are available, including polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation and ultrafiltration, which are suitable for processing moderate to large volumes of wastewater 44. Additionally, research has indicated that viruses in wastewater tend to associate with solid particles 3. Therefore, exploring solids-based methods that involve concentrating and analyzing the solid fraction of the wastewater, even from smaller initial volumes (e.g., 20 mL), could also be a viable approach for detecting norovirus and rotavirus in treated effluent, as demonstrated for SARS-CoV-2 46. The choice of the most appropriate concentration method will likely depend on factors such as the specific characteristics of the wastewater matrix, the available laboratory equipment, and the expertise of the personnel. While formal statistical power calculations would ideally be performed to determine the exact sample volume needed to achieve a desired level of power, these calculations often require preliminary data on the expected prevalence and variability of the viruses in the specific treated effluent being monitored 43. However, by adopting best practices for sampling frequency, duration, and volume, along with employing a sensitive detection method, the likelihood of achieving adequate statistical power for effective surveillance will be significantly enhanced.

**7\. Influence of Community Gastroenteritis Incidence**

The high incidence of waterborne gastroenteritis in the rural community has a significant influence on the wastewater sampling strategy and the interpretation of results. A high incidence suggests a greater likelihood of detecting norovirus and rotavirus in the wastewater effluent compared to a community with lower rates of these infections 35. However, it also underscores the critical need for a sensitive and frequent sampling strategy to effectively monitor trends in viral load and to detect potential outbreaks early in this vulnerable population 35. The sampling strategy might need to be more intensive, potentially involving a higher sampling frequency or the use of more sensitive detection methods, to provide timely and accurate data for public health action 35.

When interpreting the results of wastewater surveillance in a community with a high background incidence of gastroenteritis, it is important to consider that the detection of norovirus and rotavirus in the treated effluent might reflect ongoing endemic transmission rather than necessarily indicating a new outbreak 35. Therefore, quantitative data on the viral load, rather than just presence or absence, becomes particularly crucial for assessing the magnitude of the problem and the potential risk to the community 35. Monitoring trends in viral load over time will be essential for differentiating between baseline levels associated with endemic circulation and significant increases that might signal an outbreak requiring public health intervention 35. For instance, a sustained and substantial rise in the concentration of norovirus or rotavirus in the treated effluent above the established baseline could indicate an escalation in community transmission, prompting further investigation and targeted control measures. Conversely, a decrease in viral load might suggest the effectiveness of public health interventions that have been implemented. The interpretation of viral detection in treated effluent must therefore be contextualized by the high background incidence of gastroenteritis in the community, with a focus on quantitative levels and temporal trends to distinguish between endemic circulation and potential outbreak situations 35.

**8\. Regulatory Guidelines and Best Practices**

Adherence to established guidelines and best practices recommended by public health and environmental agencies is paramount for ensuring the reliability and validity of wastewater surveillance data for norovirus and rotavirus 5. The CDC's NWSS recommends twice-weekly composite sampling for wastewater surveillance, although this is primarily in the context of untreated wastewater for SARS-CoV-2 6. This recommendation highlights the general principle of frequent composite sampling for community-level pathogen monitoring. The Association of Public Health Laboratories (APHL) and the CDC provide guidance on quality control recommendations for wastewater testing, which should be diligently followed to ensure the accuracy and comparability of results 5. The World Health Organization (WHO) has designated rotavirus as a reference pathogen in its Guidelines for drinking-water quality, underscoring the public health significance of this virus and the importance of its monitoring in water sources 1.

Environmental agencies, such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), also provide important guidelines for wastewater sampling. These guidelines emphasize the need for proper safety precautions when collecting wastewater samples, as wastewater can contain various microbiological and chemical hazards 49. Protocols for sample collection, including the use of clean, non-powdered disposable gloves for each sampling location, are essential to prevent contamination 49. Proper sample preservation techniques, such as maintaining samples at refrigerated temperatures from the time of collection until testing and avoiding freezing, are crucial for preserving the integrity of viral nucleic acids 5. Additionally, maintaining a clear chain of custody for all collected samples through proper labeling and documentation is vital for tracking the samples and ensuring the traceability of results 5. By consistently following these established guidelines and best practices, the wastewater surveillance program for norovirus and rotavirus in the rural community can generate high-quality, reliable data that can effectively inform public health interventions and protect the health of the community.

**9\. Proposed Effective Sampling Strategy**

Based on the analysis of the characteristics of norovirus and rotavirus, the performance of small-scale wastewater treatment plants, the comparison of different sampling methods, and the recommendations from public health and environmental agencies, the following sampling strategy is proposed for detecting norovirus and rotavirus in the treated wastewater effluent of the small-scale treatment plant serving the rural community:

* **Sampling Method:** Employ 24-hour composite sampling of the treated wastewater effluent. This method will provide a more representative sample of the average viral load over a daily cycle, increasing the likelihood of detecting intermittent shedding.  
* **Sampling Frequency:** Collect composite samples at least twice per week. This frequency aligns with CDC recommendations for wastewater surveillance and provides sufficient temporal resolution to monitor potential changes in viral load, especially in a high-incidence community. Consider increasing the frequency during peak norovirus seasons.  
* **Sample Volume:** Collect a minimum of 1 liter of treated effluent for each 24-hour composite sample. This larger volume will increase the chances of capturing sufficient viral particles for detection, given the potentially low concentrations in treated effluent.  
* **Concentration Method:** Utilize a suitable virus concentration method, such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation or ultrafiltration, to reduce the sample volume and concentrate the viruses prior to nucleic acid extraction. The selection of the method should consider the efficiency for norovirus and rotavirus and the available laboratory resources. Exploring methods that focus on the solid fraction of wastewater might also be beneficial.  
* **Detection Method:** Employ a sensitive molecular detection method, such as reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) or digital PCR (dPCR), for the detection and quantification of norovirus and rotavirus RNA. dPCR may be preferred for its enhanced sensitivity and ability to provide absolute quantification, which is valuable for trend analysis.  
* **Quality Control:** Implement rigorous quality control measures throughout the sampling and testing process. This includes proper labeling of samples with pertinent information, maintaining a detailed chain of custody, ensuring proper sample preservation (refrigeration at 4°C until processing, avoiding freezing), and including appropriate positive and negative controls during nucleic acid extraction and PCR amplification. Adhere to quality control guidelines recommended by APHL and the CDC.

**10\. Conclusion and Recommendations for Public Health Action**

In conclusion, establishing a robust wastewater surveillance program for norovirus and rotavirus in the treated effluent of the small-scale treatment plant is a critical step in protecting the health of the rural community with a high incidence of waterborne gastroenteritis. The proposed sampling strategy, incorporating 24-hour composite sampling at least twice per week with a minimum sample volume of 1 liter followed by concentration and sensitive molecular detection, is designed to maximize the likelihood of detecting these viruses, even at low and variable concentrations.

Based on this analysis, the following recommendations for public health action are provided:

* Implement the proposed routine wastewater surveillance program for norovirus and rotavirus in the treated effluent of the small-scale wastewater treatment plant.  
* Establish a baseline of viral load levels in the treated effluent through initial monitoring to help differentiate between endemic circulation and potential outbreak situations.  
* Continuously monitor trends in the quantitative levels of norovirus and rotavirus over time to detect any significant increases or outbreaks in the community.  
* Correlate the wastewater surveillance data with clinical case data of gastroenteritis from the community to understand the relationship between viral detection in the effluent and the actual incidence of illness.  
* Investigate any significant and sustained increases in viral load detected in the treated effluent to identify potential causes, such as treatment plant operational issues or a surge in community infections.  
* Utilize the data from the wastewater surveillance program to inform and guide public health interventions, such as implementing targeted hygiene education campaigns, issuing advisories to the community, or recommending that individuals with symptoms seek medical attention.  
* If high levels of norovirus or rotavirus are consistently detected in the treated effluent, consider a comprehensive investigation of the wastewater treatment plant's performance and the potential for contamination of the drinking water source.  
* Engage with community leaders, healthcare providers, and residents to raise awareness about the transmission of norovirus and rotavirus and the role of wastewater surveillance in safeguarding public health.

Further research could focus on evaluating the effectiveness of the specific treatment methods used in the small-scale plant against norovirus and rotavirus, optimizing sampling strategies tailored to rural settings with limited resources, and developing predictive models that use wastewater surveillance data to forecast the risk of gastroenteritis outbreaks, allowing for more proactive public health responses.
