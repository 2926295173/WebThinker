# **Adapting Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Training for a Client with Co-occurring Borderline Personality Disorder and High-Functioning Autism**

**1\. Introduction: Navigating the Intersection of DBT, BPD, and High-Functioning Autism**

Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) is a structured psychotherapeutic approach originally developed by Marsha Linehan to treat individuals with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) 1. It is a form of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) that integrates change-oriented strategies with acceptance-based principles, most notably mindfulness 1. The primary aim of DBT is to equip individuals with a set of skills that enable them to manage intense emotions, reduce conflict in their relationships, and ultimately build a life that they experience as worth living 5. At its core, DBT operates on the principle of dialectical thinking, which emphasizes the importance of finding a balance between seemingly opposing ideas, such as acceptance of one's current reality and the need for change to improve one's life 1. The therapy is premised on the understanding that many psychological difficulties arise from deficits in essential coping skills, and by providing clients with these skills, they can lead more fulfilling and productive lives 3. A comprehensive DBT program typically involves several components, including weekly individual therapy sessions to support skill learning and address personal challenges, weekly skills training group sessions where specific skills are taught, phone coaching for in-the-moment guidance on skill utilization, and a therapist consultation team to ensure that therapists adhere to DBT principles and receive support 4.

Borderline Personality Disorder is characterized by a pervasive pattern of instability in interpersonal relationships, self-image, and affects, and marked impulsivity. Individuals with BPD often experience intense mood swings, difficulty managing anger, unstable and chaotic relationships, a profound fear of abandonment, and may engage in self-harming behaviors.

High-functioning autism spectrum disorder refers informally to individuals on the autism spectrum who possess average or above-average intellectual abilities and typically have the capacity for verbal communication and independent management of basic life skills 11. While capable in many areas, these individuals often exhibit core characteristics of autism spectrum disorder, including persistent challenges in social communication and social interaction, alongside restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities 8. They may struggle with understanding and responding to subtle social cues, such as facial expressions and body language, and in forming and maintaining reciprocal relationships 8. Sensory sensitivities to stimuli like light, sound, and touch are also frequently reported 11. Furthermore, cognitive rigidity, characterized by inflexible thinking patterns, a strong preference for routine and predictability, and difficulty adapting to changes or considering alternative perspectives, is a common trait 11.

While DBT was initially developed for BPD, its focus on emotional regulation, distress tolerance, and interpersonal effectiveness has shown promise in treating a broader range of conditions, including autism spectrum disorder 4. Individuals with both BPD and high-functioning autism may experience significant emotional dysregulation 18, a core target of DBT. However, the standard implementation of DBT skills training, which often involves group interaction and the flexible application of skills in diverse social contexts, can be particularly challenging for individuals with high-functioning autism due to their difficulties with social interaction and rigid thinking patterns. Therefore, adapting DBT is essential to ensure that the core principles and skills are delivered in a manner that is accessible, understandable, and ultimately beneficial for this unique client profile. A nuanced understanding of both BPD and high-functioning autism is necessary to create an effective therapeutic approach that addresses the emotional intensity of BPD while accommodating the specific cognitive and social characteristics of autism.

**2\. Understanding Core DBT Principles and Standard Curriculum**

The standard Dialectical Behavior Therapy curriculum is structured around four core skills modules designed to address different aspects of emotional and behavioral dysregulation 3.

The **Mindfulness** module forms the foundation of DBT, emphasizing the cultivation of present moment awareness without judgment 1. The primary goal is to increase awareness of one's thoughts, emotions, and bodily sensations in the present moment, without getting carried away by judgments or interpretations 3. This module typically includes skills such as observing, describing, and participating in the present moment 55. It also focuses on "how" to practice mindfulness through non-judgmental observation, focusing on one thing at a time (one-mindfully), and acting effectively in the moment 55. For individuals with high-functioning autism, the abstract nature of mindfulness and its emphasis on internal focus might present challenges 51. Autistic individuals may have difficulties with interoceptive awareness, making a focus on bodily sensations potentially overwhelming 8.

The **Distress Tolerance** module teaches skills to cope with intense emotions and difficult situations in the present moment without resorting to impulsive or harmful behaviors 1. It focuses on developing acceptance of the current reality and equipping individuals with crisis survival skills 54. Key techniques include self-soothing using the five senses, distraction from painful emotions, practicing radical acceptance of what is, and finding ways to improve the current moment 1. The underlying principle is that while negative emotions can be uncomfortable, they are a normal part of life and will eventually pass 5. For individuals with autism, the concept of "radical acceptance" might be challenging, particularly if they perceive a situation as unfair or illogical 51.

The **Emotion Regulation** module aims to help individuals understand, identify, and manage their emotions more effectively 1. This involves skills such as identifying and labeling emotions, understanding the function of emotions, reducing emotional vulnerability, and changing unwanted emotions 5. Strategies taught include checking the facts to ensure the emotional response fits the situation, taking opposite action to change unwanted emotions, and building positive emotional experiences 5. A significant challenge for some individuals with high-functioning autism can be alexithymia, a difficulty in identifying and describing emotions 45.

The **Interpersonal Effectiveness** module focuses on developing skills to manage relationships, assert one's needs, set boundaries, and say no effectively while maintaining self-respect and healthy connections with others 1. Key strategies taught include the DEAR MAN skill for getting one's needs met, the GIVE skill for maintaining positive relationships, and the FAST skill for maintaining self-respect in interpersonal interactions 55. This module will likely require the most extensive adaptation for a client with high-functioning autism due to the inherent difficulties they may face in understanding social cues, non-literal language, and engaging in reciprocal social interactions 8.

Standard implementation of DBT skills training typically involves weekly group sessions lasting between 90 minutes and 2.5 hours 2. A full cycle of skills training usually takes approximately six months to one year to cover all four modules 2. Clients are generally expected to attend weekly individual therapy sessions concurrently with the skills group 9. Skills are taught didactically with opportunities for in-session practice and homework assignments to facilitate application in daily life 3. This standard group format might be overwhelming for individuals with high-functioning autism due to the social interaction demands and potential sensory sensitivities inherent in a group setting 8.

**3\. Characteristics of High-Functioning Autism and Their Impact on DBT**

Rigid thinking patterns are a core characteristic of high-functioning autism, referring to a difficulty in adapting thoughts and behaviors to new information or changing circumstances 33. This often manifests as concrete, literal, and absolute thinking, with a preference for predictability and resistance to change 33. Individuals may struggle to consider different perspectives or navigate "gray areas" 33. This cognitive inflexibility can significantly impact the application of DBT, particularly the dialectical principle of balancing acceptance and change, and the concept of "wise mind" which requires integrating seemingly contradictory viewpoints 1. Abstract concepts and skills demanding flexible thinking might be especially challenging.

Adherence to routines is another common trait, with individuals often finding comfort and security in predictable schedules and rituals 12. Changes in these routines can lead to anxiety, distress, or meltdowns 16. The standard weekly schedule of DBT skills training might be beneficial in providing a routine, but unexpected changes could be disruptive. Homework assignments requiring deviation from routine might also pose difficulties.

Difficulties with social cues and reciprocity are a hallmark of autism spectrum disorder 8. This includes challenges in understanding and responding to nonverbal communication, limited interest in reciprocal conversations, and difficulties in forming and maintaining friendships 8. Understanding humor, sarcasm, and non-literal language can also be impaired 11. The group-based nature of DBT skills training, which relies on social interaction and understanding group dynamics, can be particularly challenging. Role-playing and group discussions might be difficult, and interpersonal effectiveness skills requiring social nuance will need careful adaptation.

Potential sensory sensitivities are also prevalent in high-functioning autism, with individuals experiencing over- or under-sensitivity to various sensory inputs 8. Sensory overload can lead to anxiety, distress, or meltdowns 15. The sensory environment of a group therapy room could be overwhelming, and certain mindfulness practices focusing on bodily sensations might be aversive.

**4\. Evidence-Based Adaptations of DBT for Autism Spectrum Disorder**

A growing body of research indicates that Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), when appropriately adapted, can be a beneficial intervention for autistic adults, particularly in addressing emotion dysregulation and suicidal behaviors 18. Studies have demonstrated positive impacts of adapted DBT on various autism-related challenges, including enhanced emotion regulation skills, reduced anxiety, improved social interactions, and a decrease in self-injurious behaviors 4. Radically Open DBT (RO-DBT), a specialized adaptation of traditional DBT tailored for individuals with overcontrolled personality styles, has also shown promise for autistic individuals 4.

Several key adaptation strategies have been identified as crucial for making DBT more accessible and effective for individuals with autism spectrum disorder. One significant modification involves **simplifying language** to ensure clarity and avoid abstract concepts, metaphors, and sarcasm 4. The **utilization of visual aids** is another frequently recommended adaptation, including charts, diagrams, social stories, and visual schedules to enhance understanding and provide structure 4. Providing **additional structure and repetition** in the learning process, with clear step-by-step instructions and consistent routines, can also be beneficial 4. Incorporating the client's **special interests** into therapy activities and homework can increase engagement 43. Addressing **sensory needs** by creating a sensory-friendly therapy environment is also crucial 8. Allowing for a **paced learning** approach tailored to the individual's processing speed can prevent overwhelm 43, and using **engaging formats** like gaming elements can enhance participation 43. Finally, a consistent **focus on clear and concrete strategies** for managing emotions and social interactions is essential 26. Experts in the field emphasize the importance of individualization and flexibility when applying DBT to autistic individuals, highlighting the need for therapists to be knowledgeable about both DBT and autism and willing to adapt standard techniques 46.

**5\. Strategies for Addressing Rigid Thinking in DBT**

To address the challenge of rigid thinking in a client with co-occurring BPD and high-functioning autism undergoing DBT skills training, several specific strategies can be employed.

Utilizing **clear and concrete language** is paramount. This involves avoiding ambiguous terms, therapeutic jargon, and abstract concepts that the client might struggle to interpret 25. Instead, therapists should use direct, literal language and provide specific, real-life examples to illustrate DBT principles and skills 26. Breaking down complex skills into smaller, more manageable steps can also enhance understanding and reduce feelings of being overwhelmed 26.

Providing **logical explanations** for each DBT skill and its potential benefits can also be highly effective 36. Clearly articulating the rationale behind a skill and how it can help manage specific triggers and emotional responses in a logical, cause-and-effect manner can resonate with the client's preference for understanding the "why" 19. When addressing black-and-white thinking, therapists can use logical reasoning and concrete examples to explain different perspectives and the validity of multiple viewpoints 1.

**Gradually introducing flexibility** is another key strategy. Therapists should acknowledge and validate the client's need for routine and predictability, starting with a structured and predictable therapy environment 4. Small, manageable changes can then be introduced incrementally, with the use of visual supports like social stories or visual schedules to prepare the client for what to expect 36. Incorporating games and activities that naturally require flexibility and problem-solving can also be a helpful approach 36. Modeling flexible behavior and verbalizing the thought process behind adapting to changes can provide a practical example for the client 39, and praising and reinforcing any instances of flexible thinking, even small ones, can encourage further adaptation 36.

**6\. Research Methods for Accommodating Social Interaction Difficulties within a DBT Skills Group Setting**

When considering a DBT skills group for a client with co-occurring BPD and high-functioning autism, several modifications to the standard group format can help accommodate their social interaction difficulties.

**Potential modifications to group activities** include reducing the overall group size to minimize social overload 64. Structuring group activities with clear, explicit rules and providing written or visual instructions can also reduce ambiguity and anxiety 25. Incorporating more individual reflection time and written exercises alongside group discussions can allow the client to process information at their own pace before verbalizing in the group 4. When using role-playing, providing clear and specific scripts with defined roles can make participation less anxiety-provoking 26. Ensuring opportunities for breaks and access to a designated quiet space can help manage potential sensory overload or social fatigue 31. Where appropriate, incorporating the client's special interests into group activities might also increase their engagement and comfort in interacting 43.

The **use of visual aids** can be particularly beneficial. Utilizing visual schedules to outline the group session structure can provide predictability 25. Visual representations of DBT skills and concepts, such as charts and diagrams, can make abstract ideas more concrete 26. Social stories can be used to illustrate social situations and effective responses 19.

Given the potential challenges of a group setting, the **option of individual skills training** should also be considered 54. This format allows for a more tailored approach to address the client's specific social communication difficulties and rigid thinking at their own pace 8. It provides more individualized attention and opportunities for practice in a less socially demanding environment 64 and can focus on building foundational skills before potentially transitioning to a modified group setting 68.

**7\. Investigating How to Tailor the Teaching of Specific DBT Skills (e.g., Interpersonal Effectiveness) to Account for the Client's Challenges in Understanding Social Nuances and Engaging in Reciprocal Interactions**

Tailoring the teaching of interpersonal effectiveness skills in DBT for a client with high-functioning autism requires a focus on explicit instruction and concrete strategies to address their challenges in understanding social nuances and engaging in reciprocal interactions.

**Explicit instruction on social cues** is essential. This involves directly teaching the client how to identify and interpret various social cues, such as facial expressions, body language, and tone of voice, possibly using visual aids like pictures or videos 19. Providing explicit explanations of social norms and expectations in different situations can also be beneficial 22. Using concrete examples of appropriate and inappropriate social behaviors in specific scenarios can further enhance understanding 26.

The focus should be on **concrete communication strategies**. This includes emphasizing clear, direct, and literal communication 25. Teaching specific phrases and scripts for asking for needs, setting boundaries, and saying no can provide tangible tools for social interactions 55. Practicing reciprocal interactions through structured role-playing with the therapist, focusing on turn-taking, topic maintenance, and active listening, can help build these skills in a controlled environment 26.

**Utilizing visual supports for interpersonal skills** can also be highly effective. Creating visual aids illustrating the steps involved in interpersonal effectiveness skills, such as flowcharts for DEAR MAN, can provide a clear framework. Social stories can depict social scenarios and demonstrate effective communication and boundary-setting 19. Visual cues can also be used during role-playing or real-life practice to prompt the use of specific interpersonal skills.

**8\. Exploring the Potential Benefits and Challenges of Incorporating Individual Therapy Sessions Alongside or Instead of Group Skills Training for This Client Profile**

Incorporating individual therapy sessions alongside or instead of group skills training presents both potential benefits and challenges for a client with co-occurring BPD and high-functioning autism.

**Benefits of individual therapy** include providing a safe and less overwhelming environment for processing emotions and learning skills 8. It allows for a highly individualized approach tailored to the client's specific needs, pace, and cognitive style 8, facilitating a stronger therapeutic relationship and more direct feedback 8. Individual sessions can address specific challenges related to rigid thinking and sensory sensitivities in a focused manner 8 and may serve as a necessary precursor to group therapy 68.

However, relying solely on individual therapy also presents **challenges**. Standard DBT emphasizes the importance of the skills group for practicing interpersonal effectiveness in a social context and gaining peer support 1. Individual therapy alone might limit opportunities for generalizing social skills 8 and can be more costly and time-intensive 64.

Considering a **hybrid approach** might offer the optimal solution. This could involve starting with individual therapy to build foundational skills and then transitioning to a modified skills group 68. Combining individual sessions with occasional or shorter group sessions, or using individual sessions to process challenges encountered in the group, could also be beneficial.

| Therapy Format | Potential Benefits for Client with Co-occurring BPD and High-Functioning Autism | Potential Challenges for Same Client Profile |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Group Skills Training** | Provides opportunities to practice interpersonal skills with peers (even with modifications) 1; potential for peer support and shared experience 1; consistent weekly routine 38. | Can be overwhelming due to social interaction demands and difficulty interpreting social cues 8; potential for sensory overload 8. |
| **Individual Skills Training** | Safe and less overwhelming environment 8; highly individualized and tailored approach 8; stronger therapeutic relationship and direct feedback 8; focused attention on rigid thinking and sensory sensitivities 8. | Limited opportunities for practicing interpersonal skills in a real-time social context 1; lack of peer support and shared experiences 1; potentially limits generalization of social skills 8; can be more costly and time-intensive 64. |

**9\. Identifying Resources or Tools That Can Aid in the Adaptation Process**

Several resources and tools can assist in adapting DBT skills training for a client with co-occurring BPD and high-functioning autism.

Modified DBT workbooks specifically designed for neurodivergent individuals can be particularly helpful. "The Neurodivergent Friendly Workbook of DBT Skills" by Sonny Jane Wise reframes DBT skills to be neurodivergent affirming, incorporating sensory strategies and addressing meltdowns and stimming 58. Other potentially useful workbooks include "The Neurodivergence Skills Workbook for Autism and ADHD" by Jennifer Kemp 58, "DBT FOR AUTISM: Using Dbt to Build Emotional Resilience" by Patrick Moore 70, and "The Neurodivergent Friendly Workbook of DBT Techniques" by Yevhenii Lozovyi 71. These resources aim to make DBT more accessible by using clearer language and incorporating elements relevant to the neurodivergent experience.

Supplementary materials designed for individuals with autism spectrum disorder can also be valuable. This includes visual aids such as emotion charts, social skills stories, and visual schedules 19. Organizations like the Autistic Self Advocacy Network (ASAN) offer resources and insights from the autism community 69. Websites and online forums dedicated to autism and neurodiversity can also provide practical tips and perspectives.

Finally, training and consultation resources are crucial for therapists. Behavioral Tech offers training in standard DBT 7, while PESI provides training specifically on adapting DBT for neurodivergent clients 61. Consulting with experts in both DBT and autism spectrum disorder can provide invaluable guidance in tailoring the treatment approach.

**10\. Conclusion and Recommendations**

Adapting Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) skills training for a client with co-occurring Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) and high-functioning autism requires a thoughtful and flexible approach that acknowledges the unique challenges presented by this dual diagnosis. Key adaptation strategies include emphasizing clear, concrete, and logical communication; utilizing visual aids extensively; providing structure, predictability, and repetition; gradually introducing flexibility; carefully considering the group setting and potentially opting for individual skills training or a modified group approach; proactively addressing sensory sensitivities; and incorporating the client's special interests to enhance engagement.

For effective implementation, a thorough assessment of the client's specific challenges, strengths, and sensory sensitivities is essential. Collaboration with the client and any relevant support systems is crucial. Prioritizing the development of a strong therapeutic relationship based on validation and understanding is paramount. Therapists should remain flexible and willing to adjust the treatment approach based on the client's needs and feedback. Considering a hybrid model of individual and modified group therapy may offer the optimal balance. Utilizing available resources, such as modified workbooks and supplementary materials, and seeking ongoing training and consultation are highly recommended.

When thoughtfully adapted, DBT holds significant potential to empower individuals with co-occurring BPD and high-functioning autism. By providing them with concrete skills to manage intense emotions, navigate interpersonal relationships, tolerate distress, and increase mindfulness, DBT can contribute to improved emotional regulation, enhanced social functioning, and a more fulfilling life.
