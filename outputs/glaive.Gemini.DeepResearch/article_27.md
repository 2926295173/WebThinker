# **Implications of the *Persicaria*\-*Polygonum* Taxonomic Revision on Phylogenetic Understanding and Floral Evolution Studies in Polygonoideae**

**1\. Introduction**

The family Polygonaceae, commonly known as the knotweed family, encompasses a diverse array of plant species distributed globally, with a notable presence in temperate regions 1. Within this family, the subfamily Polygonoideae has presented significant taxonomic challenges due to considerable morphological variation and plasticity across its constituent genera 1. Historically, the genus *Polygonum* was circumscribed very broadly, accommodating a large number of species that have since been segregated into more narrowly defined genera, including *Fagopyrum*, *Fallopia*, *Persicaria*, *Bistorta*, *Koenigia*, and *Reynoutria* 2. The appropriate definition of *Polygonum* has been a subject of ongoing debate within the botanical community 4. Recent advancements in molecular phylogenetic analyses have provided crucial evidence necessitating a revision of these long-standing classifications. Contrary to the initial premise of this inquiry, contemporary understanding, supported by robust molecular data, indicates that *Persicaria* is now recognized as a distinct genus, separate from a more narrowly defined *Polygonum* (sensu stricto), rather than being subsumed within it 2. This taxonomic revision is pivotal for accurately reflecting the evolutionary relationships within the Polygonoideae subfamily. This report will explore the implications of this separation for our comprehension of phylogenetic relationships and its subsequent effects on the interpretation of morphological and molecular data, particularly in the context of future studies investigating the evolution of floral morphology in these plant lineages.

**2\. Historical Distinction Between *Polygonum* and *Persicaria***

Prior to the widespread adoption of molecular phylogenetics, the distinction between *Polygonum* and *Persicaria* relied primarily on morphological characteristics 5. Generally, *Polygonum* (in its stricter contemporary sense) was often characterized as comprising herbaceous plants, frequently exhibiting swollen nodes along the stem and possessing ocreae, which are tubular sheaths formed at the base of the leaves by the fusion of stipules 2. In contrast, *Persicaria* was traditionally differentiated by a suite of features, including inflorescences that are often spike-like or capitate in form, ocreae that are typically entire, ciliate, or pectinate (fringed), and tepals (petal-like sepals) that display a characteristic trifid venation pattern 12. For instance, the species formerly known as *Polygonum persicaria*, now classified as *Persicaria maculosa*, is recognizable by a dark blotch on its leaves, often referred to as the "lady's thumb" mark, and its dense spikes of pink flowers 15. However, the presence of overlapping morphological traits across different species made a clear and consistent distinction between these two groups challenging using morphology alone 9. Even the nature of the ocrea, while present in both groups and across Polygonoideae, exhibited variations in its margin (ciliate vs. entire), serving as one of the key traditional differentiators 12. Before the widespread use of DNA sequencing, molecular data for distinguishing these groups was limited, primarily relying on chemotaxonomic markers in some instances.

**3\. Phylogenetic Basis for Reclassification (Separation)**

The advent of molecular phylogenetic studies, particularly in the 21st century, has revolutionized our understanding of plant relationships, including those within the Polygonaceae 2. The application of DNA sequencing technologies and sophisticated phylogenetic analyses has provided a wealth of data that has led to significant revisions in the classification of Polygonoideae. Several key studies have provided compelling evidence for the separation of *Persicaria* as a distinct genus from the historically broader *Polygonum* 8. Analyses utilizing sequences from the chloroplast gene *rbcL* were among the early molecular investigations that suggested *Polygonum* (sensu lato) was not a monophyletic group 4. This finding indicated that species placed within *Polygonum* were not all descended from a single common ancestor, necessitating a re-evaluation of its circumscription. Subsequent studies employing multiple gene regions, including both chloroplast (e.g., *ITS*, *matK*, *trnL-F*, *psbA-trnH IGS*) and nuclear DNA, provided stronger support for the monophyly of *Persicaria* (or a group referred to as *Eupersicaria* in some earlier treatments) as a clearly defined evolutionary lineage 8. These analyses consistently recovered *Persicaria* as a clade closely related to other genera like *Tovara* and *Echinocaulon*, forming a larger group that is now recognized as the tribe Persicarieae, distinct from the tribe Polygoneae, which contains *Polygonum* (sensu stricto) 4. The concept of polyphyly is central to understanding this taxonomic shift. A polyphyletic group is one in which the members are derived from multiple ancestral forms not common to all members. The molecular data demonstrated that the traditional broad circumscription of *Polygonum* included lineages that were more closely related to other genera than they were to the core *Polygonum* species 5. The consistent and independent recovery of *Persicaria* as a monophyletic group or as part of a larger, well-supported clade (Persicarieae) across numerous molecular studies utilizing diverse genetic markers and analytical methods provided the robust evidence required for its recognition as a separate genus. Common phylogenetic methods such as maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian inference were instrumental in constructing evolutionary trees from the DNA sequence data, allowing researchers to visualize and statistically evaluate the relationships between different plant groups.

**4\. Impact on Phylogenetic Understanding of Polygonoideae**

The separation of *Persicaria* from *Polygonum* (sensu lato) has significantly refined our understanding of the phylogenetic relationships within the subfamily Polygonoideae 4. This revision has contributed to a more accurate tribal classification within the subfamily. Based on molecular phylogenetic evidence, Polygonoideae is now understood to be divided into several tribes, including Persicarieae, Polygoneae, Rumiceae, and Fagopyreae 4. *Persicaria*, along with related genera like *Bistorta* and *Koenigia*, is placed within the tribe Persicarieae, while *Polygonum* (sensu stricto) belongs to the tribe Polygoneae 4. This tribal arrangement reflects the evolutionary history and relationships inferred from the molecular data. The goal of this reclassification is to establish more monophyletic genera, meaning each genus ideally includes all the descendants of a single common ancestor. The separation of *Persicaria* has largely achieved this for both *Persicaria* and the now more narrowly defined *Polygonum* 8. However, some challenges and unresolved relationships still exist within Polygonoideae, such as the noted polyphyly of *Fallopia* 20. Furthermore, the revised phylogeny has implications for understanding the biogeographic history and dispersal patterns within Polygonoideae 1. For example, studies suggest that while many genera within the subfamily originated and diversified in Asia, some have experienced multiple long-distance dispersal events to other continents 1. The clearer delineation of genera like *Persicaria* and *Polygonum* allows for more precise investigations into their individual biogeographic histories and evolutionary radiations. The placement of *Persicaria* within the tribe Persicarieae, which appears to be a well-supported monophyletic group, strengthens our confidence in the evolutionary framework for this part of the subfamily 8.

**5\. Reinterpreting Morphological Data**

The taxonomic revision necessitates a reinterpretation of existing morphological data, particularly concerning floral morphology, across the now distinct genera *Polygonum* (sensu stricto) and *Persicaria* (sensu lato) 10. The floral characteristics of the more narrowly defined *Polygonum* genus typically include flowers with five oblong tepals, and in some species like *Polygonum aviculare* and *P. equisetiforme*, they exhibit distyly, a form of heterostyly where flowers occur in two or more forms with different lengths of styles and stamens 23. In contrast, *Persicaria* encompasses a broader range of floral morphologies, often characterized by spike-like or capitate inflorescences bearing flowers with 4-5 lobed tepals displaying trifid venation, and typically possessing 4-8 stamens 12. The reclassification requires a re-evaluation of morphological characters that were previously used to group species now recognized as belonging to different genera. Key morphological features that now serve to distinguish *Polygonum* (sensu stricto) from *Persicaria* include the structure of the flower (e.g., the presence or absence of flower appendages), the type of ocrea (ciliate or pectinate in *Persicaria* versus often different in *Polygonum*), the venation pattern of the tepals (trifid in *Persicaria*), and the morphology of the stamen filaments (non-dilated in *Persicaria*) 13. However, it is important to acknowledge that challenges remain in finding universally consistent morphological characters due to phenomena like convergent evolution, where unrelated lineages evolve similar traits, and morphological plasticity, where a single species can exhibit a range of forms depending on environmental conditions 9.

To better illustrate the key morphological differences, consider the following table:

**Table 1: Comparison of Key Morphological Characteristics of *Polygonum* (sensu stricto) and *Persicaria* (sensu lato)**

| Characteristic | Polygonum (sensu stricto) | Persicaria (sensu lato) | Source Snippets |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Inflorescence type | Often axillary flowers or small clusters | Typically spike-like or capitate racemes or panicles | 12, 13, 14 |
| Ocrea margin | Variable, may be fringed, toothed, or lacerate | Usually entire, ciliate, or pectinate | 12, 13, 10 |
| Tepal venation | Not consistently trifid | Typically trifid | 12, 13, 14 |
| Stamen filament | Often dilated at the base | Non-dilated | 13, 24, 14 |
| Flower appendages | May be present in some species | Generally absent | 13 |
| Leaf shape | Variable, often lanceolate to elliptic | Variable, can be lanceolate, ovate, or linear-lanceolate | 29, 16, 12 |
| Nodes | Often swollen | Often swollen | 11, 16, 9 |
| Ocrea shape | Cylindric to funnelform | Cylindric to funnelform | 10 |

This table highlights some of the key morphological distinctions that are now considered more significant in light of the molecularly supported separation of the two genera.

**6\. Reinterpreting Molecular Data in Floral Evolution Studies**

The reclassification of *Persicaria* as a distinct genus has a significant impact on the interpretation of molecular data in studies specifically focused on the evolution of floral traits within this group 9. Researchers investigating floral evolution using molecular data must now consider the revised generic boundaries to ensure that comparisons are made between truly homologous genes in related lineages within the appropriate genus. The more robust phylogenetic framework resulting from the reclassification provides a clearer understanding of the evolutionary relationships between species, which is crucial for accurately studying the evolution of floral characteristics 9. This framework allows for the mapping of floral characters onto the phylogeny, enabling the inference of the direction and rate of evolutionary changes in floral morphology within *Polygonum* (sensu stricto) and *Persicaria* separately. Future studies can leverage this revised taxonomy to investigate the genetic basis of floral morphology within each genus, potentially uncovering distinct evolutionary pathways and genetic mechanisms driving floral development in these now-separated lineages. For instance, identifying the specific genes involved in the development of trifid tepal venation in *Persicaria* versus the floral development in *Polygonum* could reveal unique evolutionary trajectories. Furthermore, the reclassification might influence the interpretation of molecular data related to hybridization and polyploidy, particularly within *Persicaria*, where evidence suggests that polyploid speciation has played a significant role in its diversification 26. Recognizing *Persicaria* as a distinct entity allows for more focused molecular analyses to understand the frequency and impact of such events on its floral evolution, potentially revealing patterns that were obscured when it was considered part of a broader *Polygonum*.

**7\. Challenges and Opportunities for Future Research**

The taxonomic change presents both challenges and opportunities for future research 3. One of the primary challenges is the potential for confusion in the existing scientific literature due to the historical usage of the name *Polygonum* in a broader sense. Researchers will need to be mindful of this historical context when interpreting older studies. Additionally, there is a need to update databases, floras, and identification keys to accurately reflect the new classification, which requires a significant effort from the botanical community. Re-analyzing existing datasets that might have combined data from species now placed in different genera will also be necessary to ensure the validity of previous findings in light of the revised taxonomy. Addressing any remaining ambiguities or unresolved relationships within Polygonoideae, such as the polyphyly of *Fallopia*, continues to be a challenge 20. However, this taxonomic revision also presents exciting opportunities for future research. It provides a renewed impetus for conducting more focused comparative studies of morphology, anatomy, and molecular data within the now well-defined genera of *Polygonum* (sensu stricto) and *Persicaria*. This allows for a more precise investigation into the evolutionary drivers behind the divergence of floral morphology between these two lineages. Researchers can now explore the specific role of hybridization and polyploidy in the diversification of *Persicaria* in light of its distinct phylogenetic position 26. The application of phylogenomic approaches, utilizing large-scale genomic data, can further refine the phylogeny of Polygonoideae and provide deeper insights into the evolution of floral characters at a more detailed level 9. Studying the biogeographic history of *Polygonum* (sensu stricto) and *Persicaria* separately can also shed light on their distinct evolutionary trajectories and adaptations to different environments 1.

**8\. Re-evaluation of Evolutionary Trends**

The reclassification of *Persicaria* necessitates a re-evaluation of previously established evolutionary trends or character state transitions in floral morphology within the Polygonoideae 23. Floral character state transitions that were previously inferred based on a broader concept of *Polygonum* might now be understood as representing distinct evolutionary trajectories within *Polygonum* (sensu stricto) and *Persicaria*. For example, the evolution of the number of tepals, the arrangement of stamens, or the type of inflorescence might show different patterns when these genera are analyzed separately. It is possible that similar floral features observed in both groups might have arisen through convergent evolution, representing independent adaptations to similar selective pressures, rather than indicating a shared evolutionary history within a single genus. Furthermore, the reclassification may impact our understanding of the evolution of pollination syndromes within these lineages. If *Polygonum* (sensu stricto) and *Persicaria* exhibit distinct floral morphologies, they might also attract different pollinators, suggesting the evolution of different pollination strategies that correlate with the current generic boundaries. Ancestral state reconstruction analyses, which aim to infer the characteristics of ancestral taxa, will also be affected by the revised phylogeny. By using a more accurate evolutionary tree that reflects the separation of *Persicaria*, these analyses can provide a more nuanced understanding of how floral morphology has evolved over time within the Polygonoideae subfamily, potentially revealing evolutionary trends that were previously obscured.

**9\. Conclusion**

The taxonomic separation of *Persicaria* from *Polygonum* (sensu lato), driven by robust molecular phylogenetic evidence, represents a significant advancement in our understanding of the evolutionary relationships within the subfamily Polygonoideae. This revision has clarified the tribal classification within the subfamily and contributed to the establishment of more monophyletic genera. The reclassification has a direct impact on the interpretation of both morphological and molecular data, particularly in the context of studies focused on the evolution of floral morphology. It necessitates a re-evaluation of existing morphological data and provides a more accurate phylogenetic framework for future molecular investigations. While challenges remain in navigating the historical literature and updating taxonomic resources, this taxonomic change offers exciting opportunities for more focused and informative research into the evolutionary history and diversification of these important plant lineages. Future studies that incorporate this revised taxonomic framework will undoubtedly lead to a more accurate and nuanced understanding of the fascinating evolution of floral morphology within the Polygonoideae.
