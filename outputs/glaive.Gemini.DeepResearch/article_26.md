# **Implications of Multiple Dengue Strain Transmission by *Aedes aegypti* in Urban Lagos, Nigeria: Adapting Vector Control and Public Health Strategies**

**1\. Introduction: Dengue Fever in Lagos and the Emergence of Multiple Strain Transmission by *Aedes aegypti***

Dengue fever stands as a significant global public health challenge, with its prevalence and geographical distribution steadily expanding, particularly within the densely populated urban centers of tropical and subtropical regions. Nigeria, and specifically its bustling metropolis of Lagos State, has long borne a considerable burden of this mosquito-borne viral illness 1. Historically, the understanding of dengue transmission has centered on the *Aedes aegypti* mosquito as the primary vector responsible for spreading the four distinct serotypes of the dengue virus (DENV 1-4) 3. Each serotype, while causing a spectrum of illness, was generally considered to be transmitted individually by an infected mosquito during a single feeding event.

However, a recent and critical discovery has emerged in urban Lagos, revealing that *Aedes aegypti* mosquitoes in this region possess the ability to transmit multiple strains, which could refer to different serotypes or genotypes, of dengue fever within a relatively short period \[User Query\]. This novel finding represents a significant shift in our understanding of dengue transmission dynamics and carries profound implications for the effectiveness of existing control strategies, which were largely formulated based on the paradigm of single-strain transmission per vector. This report aims to analyze the potential consequences of this newly identified transmission capability on the epidemiology and severity of dengue in Lagos. Furthermore, it will evaluate the adequacy of current vector control strategies in light of this challenge and propose evidence-based adaptations to both vector control and broader public health efforts. Recognizing the complex epidemiological landscape of Lagos, this analysis will also consider the concurrent threat of overlapping outbreaks of other vector-borne diseases prevalent in the region, most notably Lassa fever and yellow fever.

The ability of *Aedes aegypti* to transmit multiple dengue strains suggests a potential evolution in the vector's competence or a change in the interaction between the mosquito and the virus \[Insight 1\]. This could manifest as the mosquito being able to harbor and transmit more than one serotype simultaneously, or it might involve the mosquito becoming infected with different serotypes in quick succession and transmitting them within a short timeframe. Such a change could lead to a more efficient cycle of disease transmission and a heightened risk of co-infections in the human population. Understanding the underlying mechanisms driving this increased transmission efficiency is crucial for developing targeted and effective interventions. Moreover, the simultaneous presence of dengue alongside Lassa fever and yellow fever in Lagos creates a complex public health scenario \[Insight 2\]. These diseases share some initial clinical features, potentially leading to challenges in differential diagnosis and placing a significant strain on available public health resources. This necessitates the implementation of integrated and well-coordinated response strategies to effectively manage the burden of all three diseases.

**2\. Current Landscape of Dengue in Lagos, Nigeria:**

**2.1. Prevalence and Endemicity of Dengue Virus:**

Lagos State, situated within the southwestern region of Nigeria, has historically experienced a significant burden of dengue fever, with the region carrying the highest prevalence of the disease in the country 1. Studies indicate that dengue has been endemic in Nigeria for several decades, with an average prevalence rate of 21% observed between 2001 and 2023 1. Notably, Nigeria was classified as a hyperendemic region for dengue between 2009 and 2020, signifying the co-circulation of all four distinct serotypes of the dengue virus (DENV 1-4) within the country 1. Recent investigations have confirmed the continued presence of all four serotypes in various parts of Nigeria 1. Specific studies conducted in Lagos have identified the active circulation of multiple serotypes in recent years. For instance, a study conducted between April and August 2018 detected DENV-1 (genotype I) and DENV-3 (genotype I) among febrile patients in Lagos 5. While this study highlighted the co-circulation of different serotypes within the human population, the recent discovery points to the ability of individual *Aedes aegypti* mosquitoes in Lagos to transmit more than one strain, which could encompass different serotypes or genotypes, potentially within a single feeding or a short period. Serological surveys in other regions of Nigeria have further underscored the widespread exposure to dengue, with approximately 28% of screened patients in the rainforest region showing evidence of past DENV infection 3. These findings collectively illustrate the established endemicity of dengue in Lagos and the presence of multiple circulating serotypes, creating a complex epidemiological environment.

The sustained presence and co-circulation of multiple dengue serotypes in Lagos have resulted in a population with diverse immunity profiles \[Insight 3\]. Individuals may possess immunity to one or more serotypes from previous infections, but they remain susceptible to others. This immunological landscape has significant implications for the severity of subsequent dengue infections. Infection with one dengue serotype typically confers lifelong immunity to that specific serotype. However, subsequent infection with a different serotype can, in some instances, lead to a more severe form of the disease, known as Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (DHF) or Dengue Shock Syndrome (DSS), through a phenomenon called Antibody-Dependent Enhancement (ADE) 6. In ADE, antibodies developed during the first infection, while not fully neutralizing the second serotype, can paradoxically enhance its entry into immune cells, leading to increased viral replication and a more pronounced inflammatory response. The co-circulation of multiple serotypes in Lagos, coupled with the newly discovered ability of *Aedes aegypti* to transmit multiple strains, could significantly increase the likelihood of individuals experiencing these secondary, potentially severe, infections.

**2.2. Role of *Aedes aegypti* and *Aedes albopictus* as Vectors:**

The primary vector responsible for the transmission of dengue fever in Lagos, and indeed across much of Nigeria and West Africa, is the *Aedes aegypti* mosquito 1. This mosquito species is well-adapted to urban and peri-domestic environments, thriving in close proximity to human populations and readily breeding in artificial water containers commonly found around homes, such as discarded tires, flower pots, and uncovered water storage vessels. While *Aedes aegypti* is the principal vector, another species, *Aedes albopictus*, is also present in Lagos and has been identified as a vector of dengue in the region, although it is generally considered to be less efficient in transmission compared to *Ae. aegypti* 1. Studies conducted in Lagos State have confirmed the widespread presence of both *Aedes aegypti* and *Aedes albopictus*, with evidence suggesting some degree of species partitioning in their ecological distribution within the state 14. This implies that while both species contribute to the overall risk of dengue transmission in Lagos, their roles and prevalence might vary geographically depending on factors such as urbanization levels and the availability of specific breeding habitats.

A comprehensive understanding of the specific ecological niches and population dynamics of both *Aedes aegypti* and *Aedes albopictus* within Lagos is essential for the development of effective vector control strategies \[Insight 4\]. The recent discovery of multiple strain transmission primarily in *Ae. aegypti* might necessitate a more focused approach on controlling this particular vector in its prevalent urban and peri-domestic habitats. *Aedes albopictus*, while potentially playing a secondary role in dengue transmission in Lagos, is known for its greater adaptability to cooler climates and its ability to breed in a wider range of both artificial and natural water containers. Its presence suggests a potential for dengue transmission in more diverse environments and potentially during seasons when *Ae. aegypti* populations might be lower. Therefore, vector control efforts need to consider both species and their respective contributions to the overall dengue transmission risk in Lagos.

**2.3. Environmental and Socioeconomic Factors Contributing to Dengue Transmission:**

Several key environmental and socioeconomic factors prevalent in urban Lagos create highly favorable conditions for the breeding and proliferation of *Aedes* mosquitoes, thereby significantly contributing to the ongoing transmission of dengue fever \[Insight 5\]. Lagos experiences a tropical climate characterized by high temperatures and significant rainfall, particularly during the rainy seasons. These climatic conditions are conducive to the life cycle and activity of *Aedes* mosquitoes 1. Furthermore, the often-unreliable public water supply in Lagos necessitates that many households store water in various containers, such as drums, tanks, and buckets. If these containers are not properly covered or managed, they can become ideal breeding sites for *Aedes* mosquitoes 3.

Beyond climatic and water storage practices, anthropogenic factors play a crucial role in facilitating *Aedes* proliferation in Lagos. Rapid urbanization and a high population density lead to overcrowding and increased generation of solid waste 1. Improper waste management practices often result in the accumulation of discarded items like tires, plastic containers, cans, and bottles, which can collect rainwater and provide abundant breeding habitats for *Aedes* mosquitoes 4. The water-locked geography of Lagos also contributes to the problem by providing ample breeding grounds for mosquitoes 13. The interplay of these environmental and socioeconomic factors creates a complex web of conditions that support high densities of *Aedes* mosquitoes throughout urban Lagos, making vector control a persistent and multifaceted challenge that requires interventions addressing both the mosquito populations directly and the underlying environmental issues.

**3\. Implications of Multiple Dengue Strain Transmission by *Aedes aegypti***:

**3.1. Increased Risk of Severe Dengue through Antibody-Dependent Enhancement (ADE):**

The discovery that *Aedes aegypti* in urban Lagos can transmit multiple dengue strains carries significant implications for the risk of severe dengue within the population \[Insight 6\]. Antibody-Dependent Enhancement (ADE) is a critical factor in the pathogenesis of severe dengue (DHF/DSS) 3. As previously discussed, ADE occurs when an individual who has had a prior dengue infection with one serotype is subsequently infected with a different serotype. The antibodies produced during the first infection may not fully neutralize the second serotype but instead can enhance its entry into immune cells, leading to increased viral replication and a more severe disease outcome.

The ability of *Aedes aegypti* to transmit multiple dengue strains, whether simultaneously through a single bite or sequentially within a short period, could substantially increase the likelihood of individuals experiencing co-infections (simultaneous infection with more than one serotype) or sequential infections (infection with different serotypes in close succession). If a mosquito transmits multiple serotypes at once, an individual could be infected with more than one serotype simultaneously, potentially complicating the immune response and increasing the risk of severe disease. Alternatively, if a mosquito transmits one serotype and then later transmits another different serotype to the same individual within a short timeframe, this scenario closely mimics a secondary infection with a different serotype, which is a well-established risk factor for ADE and severe dengue. Consequently, the prevalence of multiple-strain transmission by *Aedes aegypti* in Lagos could lead to a higher proportion of dengue cases progressing to the more dangerous forms of DHF and DSS, posing a greater threat to public health.

**3.2. Potential for More Complex and Severe Dengue Outbreaks:**

The capacity of a single vector, *Aedes aegypti*, to transmit multiple dengue strains also has the potential to result in more complex and severe dengue outbreaks in urban Lagos \[Insight 7\]. Traditionally, dengue outbreaks might be dominated by a single serotype at any given time. However, if the vector can efficiently transmit multiple strains, it could lead to a scenario where multiple serotypes are actively circulating and potentially causing infections concurrently within the population 6. This could manifest as outbreaks with more intricate epidemiological patterns, where different serotypes might peak at different times or exhibit varying geographic distributions within the city.

Furthermore, the overall severity of dengue outbreaks in Lagos might increase due to the heightened risk of ADE associated with multiple strain transmission. With a greater likelihood of individuals experiencing secondary infections or co-infections, the proportion of severe dengue cases (DHF/DSS) within an outbreak could rise, potentially leading to a higher case fatality rate. This increased complexity and potential severity would pose significant challenges for public health authorities in Lagos in terms of predicting the trajectory of outbreaks, managing healthcare resources, and implementing effective control measures.

**3.3. Implications for Dengue Surveillance and Diagnostics:**

The discovery of *Aedes aegypti*'s ability to transmit multiple dengue strains underscores the critical need for enhanced dengue surveillance and diagnostic capabilities in Lagos \[Insight 8\]. Current surveillance systems might primarily focus on detecting the overall incidence of dengue without necessarily tracking the specific strains being transmitted by the vector population 14. However, with the possibility of a single mosquito transmitting multiple strains, it becomes even more important to understand which specific serotypes and genotypes are circulating and how their transmission dynamics are being influenced.

Diagnostic tools currently in use might not always be capable of readily differentiating between different dengue serotypes or detecting co-infections. The ability to accurately identify the infecting serotype is crucial for understanding the potential risk of severe disease due to ADE and for monitoring the evolution of dengue in the region. Furthermore, in the context of overlapping outbreaks with other febrile illnesses like Lassa fever and yellow fever, which share some initial symptoms with dengue, the need for rapid and accurate diagnostic tests that can distinguish between these diseases and detect potential co-infections becomes paramount 1. If healthcare workers are not aware of the possibility of multiple strain transmission from a single vector or if diagnostic capabilities are limited, there is a significant risk of underreporting or misdiagnosis, which can hinder effective disease management and control efforts.

**4\. Evaluation of Existing Vector Control Strategies in Urban Lagos:**

**4.1. Current Vector Control Methods and Their Focus:**

Vector control efforts in Lagos State are primarily implemented through the Lagos State Malaria Elimination Program, which employs an Integrated Vector Management (IVM) strategy 22. This program includes several key interventions aimed at reducing mosquito populations, such as the distribution of Long Lasting Insecticide Nets (LLINs), Indoor Residual Spraying (IRS), and larviciding 22. LLINs are distributed through healthcare facilities to children and pregnant women, primarily targeting the night-biting *Anopheles* mosquitoes that transmit malaria 22. IRS involves spraying the interior walls and roofs of houses with long-acting insecticides and has been implemented in specific Local Government Areas (LGAs) of Lagos, also with a primary focus on malaria vectors 22. Larviciding, the application of insecticides to water bodies to kill mosquito larvae, has been conducted in certain areas of Kosofe LGA 22. While these methods are primarily designed for malaria control, they can also have an impact on *Aedes aegypti* populations, as this mosquito often rests indoors and its larvae develop in water containers around homes \[Insight 9\]. Additionally, the Lagos State Government has, at times, conducted sanitation exercises and fumigation campaigns targeting general vector control, including *Aedes* mosquitoes 24. Community-based initiatives promoting environmental sanitation and source reduction might also be undertaken periodically.

**4.2. Effectiveness of Current Strategies Against *Aedes aegypti***:

Studies assessing the effectiveness of currently used insecticides against *Aedes aegypti* in Lagos have revealed a concerning trend of insecticide resistance \[Insight 10\]. While permethrin, a pyrethroid insecticide commonly used for mosquito control, has shown susceptibility in *Ae. aegypti* populations in both farm and nonfarm sites in Lagos 23, resistance to deltamethrin, another pyrethroid, has been observed in nonfarm areas 23. Alarmingly, widespread resistance to DDT, an organochlorine insecticide, has been reported across all tested *Ae. aegypti* populations in Lagos 23. Further investigations into the mechanisms of resistance have indicated the involvement of metabolic resistance through enzymes like cytochrome P450s and glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), as the use of the synergist piperonyl butoxide (PBO) has been shown to increase the mortality of mosquitoes resistant to DDT and permethrin 26. The presence of insecticide resistance, particularly to pyrethroids which are frequently used in IRS and LLINs, raises serious concerns about the continued effectiveness of these chemical-based vector control strategies against *Aedes aegypti* in Lagos. The effectiveness of larviciding efforts in targeting *Aedes* larvae is likely dependent on the coverage and proper application of larvicides in the diverse range of breeding habitats found in urban Lagos.

**4.3. Limitations and Challenges in the Context of Multiple Strain Transmission:**

The existing vector control strategies in urban Lagos, particularly their heavy reliance on chemical insecticides that are facing increasing resistance in *Aedes aegypti* populations, might be inadequate to effectively address the heightened complexity of dengue transmission resulting from the multiple-strain capability of the vector \[Insight 11\]. The developing resistance to pyrethroids, which are often the primary insecticides used for adult mosquito control, could significantly reduce the impact of IRS and adulticiding campaigns on *Ae. aegypti* populations, allowing for continued transmission of multiple dengue strains. Furthermore, current entomological surveillance systems in Lagos are primarily focused on malaria vectors, with a lack of continuous and robust monitoring specifically targeting *Aedes* mosquitoes and their potential to carry and transmit multiple dengue strains 14. This lack of specific surveillance data makes it challenging to tailor vector control interventions effectively against *Aedes* and to track the prevalence of multiple strain transmission in the vector population. Scaling up vector control efforts in the densely populated urban environment of Lagos presents logistical and operational challenges, requiring significant resources and coordination across various sectors and communities. The need to address the underlying environmental and socioeconomic factors that contribute to *Aedes* breeding further complicates the picture, as these issues require sustained and integrated interventions beyond just direct mosquito control.

**5\. Adapting Vector Control Strategies to Address Multiple Dengue Strain Transmission:**

**5.1. Enhancing Entomological Surveillance:**

To effectively address the challenge posed by *Aedes aegypti*'s ability to transmit multiple dengue strains, a critical first step for public health officials in Lagos is to establish a comprehensive and continuous entomological surveillance system specifically targeting *Aedes* mosquitoes within the urban environment \[Insight 12\]. This system should go beyond the current focus on malaria vectors and include regular monitoring of both adult and larval *Aedes* populations in various urban settings, including residential, commercial, and public areas 14. Key components of this enhanced surveillance should include the systematic identification and mapping of the diverse range of *Aedes* breeding sites prevalent in Lagos, such as water storage containers, discarded tires, and other artificial containers. Routine assessment of insecticide susceptibility of *Aedes aegypti* populations across different geographic areas within Lagos is also essential to inform the selection of effective insecticides for control measures. Furthermore, the surveillance system should ideally incorporate the capacity for detecting the presence of multiple dengue strains (serotypes and genotypes) within the collected mosquito populations through molecular diagnostic techniques. The data generated from this enhanced entomological surveillance will be crucial for understanding the distribution, abundance, and infection rates of *Aedes* mosquitoes in Lagos and for guiding the implementation of targeted and effective vector control interventions.

**5.2. Implementing Targeted and Integrated Vector Control Interventions:**

The data derived from enhanced entomological surveillance should be used to inform the implementation of more geographically targeted vector control strategies in Lagos, focusing on high-risk areas with high *Aedes* densities and identified breeding hotspots \[Insight 13\]. A shift towards an Integrated Vector Management (IVM) approach is crucial, combining various control methods in a strategic and sustainable manner 14. This IVM strategy should prioritize source reduction as a fundamental component, involving intensified efforts to eliminate or manage *Aedes* breeding sites through community mobilization, public education campaigns promoting environmental sanitation, and improved waste management systems to reduce the availability of water-holding containers 14. Targeted larviciding should be implemented in identified breeding sites, prioritizing the use of environmentally friendly options where feasible and appropriate 22. Adult control measures, such as fogging and indoor residual spraying, should be used judiciously, particularly during dengue outbreaks, with careful selection of insecticides based on the results of insecticide resistance monitoring to ensure effectiveness 22. Personal protective measures, including the promotion of insect repellent use, wearing protective clothing, and using insecticide-treated nets, especially during peak *Aedes* biting times (daytime and dusk/dawn), should be actively encouraged 27. Public health officials could also explore the potential for incorporating biological control agents into the IVM strategy where appropriate and safe.

**5.3. Enhancing Community Engagement and Public Awareness:**

The active engagement of communities and the implementation of effective public awareness campaigns are critical for the long-term success and sustainability of vector control efforts in Lagos \[Insight 14\]. Public health officials must recognize that many *Aedes* breeding sites are located in and around people's homes, making community participation essential for source reduction 15. Targeted public health campaigns should be developed and implemented to raise awareness among residents about the transmission of dengue fever, including the newly understood potential for multiple strain transmission by a single mosquito. These campaigns should provide clear and actionable information on effective source reduction measures that individuals and communities can easily undertake, such as regularly emptying and cleaning water storage containers, properly disposing of waste to prevent water accumulation, and clearing potential breeding sites around their homes. The importance of personal protection measures to prevent mosquito bites should also be emphasized. Furthermore, the public should be educated on the early signs and symptoms of dengue fever and encouraged to seek prompt medical attention, as well as to report any suspected dengue cases to health authorities. Community involvement and ownership of vector control activities are crucial for achieving sustained behavioral changes and reducing *Aedes* mosquito populations in urban Lagos.

**6\. Managing Overlapping Outbreaks: Dengue, Lassa Fever, and Yellow Fever in Lagos:**

**6.1. Strengthening Integrated Disease Surveillance:**

Given the concurrent presence of dengue, Lassa fever, and yellow fever in Lagos, a robust integrated disease surveillance system is urgently needed to effectively monitor and track the trends of all three diseases simultaneously \[Insight 17\]. This system should enable early detection of outbreaks, provide real-time data on their geographic distribution and temporal patterns, and facilitate coordinated responses 35. Enhancing laboratory diagnostic capacity is crucial to allow for rapid and accurate differentiation between these diseases, which often present with overlapping clinical symptoms, and to detect any potential co-infections 30. The surveillance system should also include mechanisms for timely and efficient data sharing and communication between different levels of the health system, from community health workers to state and national public health authorities, as well as with relevant stakeholders like environmental agencies.

**6.2. Enhancing Differential Diagnosis and Case Management:**

To effectively manage the overlapping outbreaks, it is essential to enhance the capacity of healthcare workers in Lagos to accurately diagnose and manage cases of dengue, Lassa fever, and yellow fever \[Insight 15\]. Training programs should be implemented to educate clinicians on the clinical presentations and differential diagnosis of these diseases, particularly in the early stages when symptoms can be similar 39. Clear diagnostic algorithms and protocols should be developed and disseminated to guide healthcare professionals in areas where these diseases are co-endemic. Furthermore, it is crucial to ensure adequate capacity for the clinical management of all three diseases, including access to appropriate supportive care for dengue and yellow fever, and specific treatments like Ribavirin for Lassa fever 30. Strengthening referral pathways and ensuring that healthcare facilities are equipped to handle cases of all three diseases are also vital.

**6.3. Coordinated Resource Allocation and Public Health Response:**

Managing concurrent outbreaks of dengue, Lassa fever, and yellow fever will inevitably place a significant strain on the public health infrastructure and resources in Lagos \[Insight 16\]. Therefore, coordinated resource allocation, including personnel, funding, and logistics, is essential to ensure an effective response to all three diseases 2. Joint preparedness and response plans should be developed that outline strategies for managing overlapping outbreaks, including clear protocols for prioritization of interventions, resource sharing between disease control programs, and coordinated public communication efforts. Strong inter-sectoral collaboration between the health sector and other relevant agencies, such as environmental protection agencies and local government authorities, is also crucial for implementing integrated control measures that address both the vector and the environmental factors contributing to disease transmission.

**7\. Integrated Vector Management (IVM) Approaches for Multiple Vector-Borne Diseases:**

**7.1. Tailoring IVM Strategies for *Aedes* and Rodent Control:**

An Integrated Vector Management (IVM) approach in Lagos needs to be tailored to target not only *Aedes* mosquitoes, responsible for transmitting dengue and yellow fever, but also the rodent vectors, primarily *Mastomys natalensis*, that spread Lassa fever \[Insight 18\]. This requires a comprehensive strategy that integrates measures targeting different vectors and their specific habitats 38. For instance, community-based clean-up campaigns can be designed to simultaneously reduce mosquito breeding sites (e.g., by removing water-holding containers) and rodent habitats (e.g., by improving waste disposal and reducing clutter around homes). Similarly, improved sanitation and waste management practices can limit both rodent populations and the accumulation of water that facilitates mosquito breeding. In areas identified as high-risk for both dengue/yellow fever and Lassa fever, targeted larviciding efforts can be combined with rodent control measures such as trapping and the promotion of rodent-proof food storage.

**7.2. Integrating Yellow Fever Vaccination with Vector Control:**

While effective vector control measures targeting *Aedes* mosquitoes will contribute to reducing the risk of yellow fever transmission, vaccination remains the most potent and cost-effective tool for preventing yellow fever outbreaks \[Insight 19\]. Public health efforts in Lagos must prioritize maintaining and further improving high coverage of the yellow fever vaccine through routine immunization programs for infants and children, as well as through targeted vaccination campaigns in areas with lower coverage or during outbreak situations 30. Integrating vaccination efforts with ongoing vector control activities can provide a synergistic approach to preventing yellow fever, with vector control helping to reduce transmission intensity and vaccination providing long-term protection to individuals.

**7.3. Ensuring Sustainability and Cost-Effectiveness of IVM:**

The implementation of IVM strategies in Lagos should prioritize methods that are sustainable in the long term and cost-effective for the local context \[Insight 20\]. This includes a strong emphasis on community involvement and ownership of vector control activities, as these are more likely to be sustained over time. Environmental management strategies, such as promoting proper waste disposal and water storage practices, are often more cost-effective and environmentally friendly than relying solely on chemical insecticides 41. Judicious use of insecticides, guided by robust surveillance data and insecticide resistance monitoring, can help to optimize their impact and minimize the development of further resistance. Exploring innovative and potentially cost-saving vector control methods, while ensuring their safety and effectiveness, should also be considered as part of a sustainable IVM program.

**8\. Recommendations and Guidelines from Public Health Organizations:**

**8.1. Leveraging WHO Strategies and Guidelines:**

Public health officials in Lagos should align their dengue and other arbovirus control strategies with the comprehensive guidance and recommendations provided by the World Health Organization (WHO) \[Insight 21\]. The WHO's Global Strategic Preparedness, Readiness and Response Plan (SPRP) for dengue and other *Aedes*\-borne arboviruses emphasizes a coordinated global response with key actions in surveillance, laboratory activities, vector control, community engagement, clinical management, and research 45. The WHO's Global Vector Control Response (GVCR) 2017–2030 offers strategic guidance for strengthening vector control as a fundamental approach to disease prevention and outbreak response, advocating for a comprehensive approach with enhanced technical capacity, improved infrastructure, strengthened monitoring, and active community mobilization 46. Specific WHO recommendations for dengue vector control include source reduction, elimination of container habitats, use of container covers, larviciding, and active community participation 27. Adhering to these evidence-based strategies and guidelines will ensure that Lagos' response to the challenge of multiple dengue strain transmission is in line with international best practices and benefits from global knowledge and resources.

**8.2. Adapting National and State Guidelines:**

Existing national guidelines from the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) and the Lagos State Ministry of Health for the prevention and control of dengue and other vector-borne diseases should be reviewed and adapted to specifically address the implications of the newly discovered multiple dengue strain transmission by *Aedes aegypti* \[Insight 22\]. These adaptations should include enhanced protocols for entomological surveillance to monitor *Aedes* populations and detect multiple strain carriage, as well as targeted vector control measures informed by this enhanced surveillance and insecticide resistance monitoring 22. The NCDC's recommendations for dengue prevention and control, such as promoting personal protection, ensuring environmental sanitation, and early detection and management of cases, should be reinforced and tailored to the specific context of Lagos 31. Leveraging the existing structures and expertise within the Lagos State Malaria Elimination Program and collaborating closely with the NCDC will be crucial for implementing these adapted guidelines effectively.

**8.3. Learning from Best Practices in Other Endemic Regions:**

Public health officials in Lagos should proactively seek information and collaborate with other regions and countries around the world that have experience in managing dengue outbreaks involving multiple circulating strains \[Insight 23\]. Learning from the successes and challenges faced by these regions in implementing surveillance systems, vector control methods, clinical management protocols, and community engagement strategies can provide valuable insights for adapting the response in Lagos to the local context 7. Knowledge exchange and collaboration with dengue-endemic regions can facilitate the adoption of proven strategies and potentially accelerate the development and implementation of effective control measures in Lagos.

**9\. Conclusion: Key Findings and Recommendations for Public Health Officials in Lagos to Mitigate the Threat of Multiple Dengue Strain Transmission.**

The recent discovery of *Aedes aegypti*'s ability to transmit multiple dengue strains in urban Lagos presents a significant challenge to existing vector control strategies and necessitates a comprehensive and adaptive public health response. Dengue is already endemic in Lagos, with multiple serotypes co-circulating, and the presence of *Aedes aegypti* and *Aedes albopictus* as vectors is well-established. Environmental and socioeconomic factors in the city create ample breeding grounds for these mosquitoes. The ability of *Aedes aegypti* to transmit multiple strains elevates the risk of severe dengue due to antibody-dependent enhancement and could lead to more complex and severe outbreaks, while also posing challenges for surveillance and diagnostics. Current vector control strategies, primarily focused on malaria, face limitations due to developing insecticide resistance in *Aedes aegypti*.

To mitigate this emerging threat, public health officials in Lagos should implement the following prioritized recommendations:

* **Strengthen and Expand Entomological Surveillance:** Establish a robust and continuous surveillance system specifically for *Aedes* mosquitoes, including regular monitoring of populations, breeding sites, and insecticide susceptibility, as well as the capacity to detect multiple dengue strains in the vector population.  
* **Implement Targeted and Integrated Vector Control Interventions:** Adopt an IVM approach that combines source reduction, larviciding, adulticiding (with resistance-informed insecticide selection), personal protection measures, and potentially biological control, focusing on high-risk areas identified through surveillance.  
* **Develop and Implement Comprehensive Community Engagement and Education Programs:** Raise public awareness about dengue transmission, including the new findings, and promote effective source reduction and personal protection measures.  
* **Enhance Diagnostic Capabilities:** Strengthen laboratory capacity for rapid and accurate diagnosis of dengue, including the ability to differentiate between serotypes and detect co-infections, especially in the context of overlapping outbreaks with Lassa fever and yellow fever.  
* **Strengthen the Integrated Disease Surveillance System:** Enhance the existing system to simultaneously monitor trends in dengue, Lassa fever, and yellow fever, facilitating early detection and coordinated responses.  
* **Adopt an Integrated Vector Management (IVM) Approach for Multiple Diseases:** Tailor IVM strategies to target both *Aedes* mosquitoes and rodent vectors of Lassa fever, integrating relevant control measures.  
* **Prioritize and Maintain High Yellow Fever Vaccination Coverage:** Ensure high vaccination rates against yellow fever as the primary preventive measure, complementing vector control efforts.  
* **Align with WHO and NCDC Guidelines:** Adapt and implement dengue control strategies in accordance with the recommendations and guidelines provided by the WHO and the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control.  
* **Learn from Experiences of Other Endemic Regions:** Actively seek collaboration and knowledge sharing with regions and countries that have successfully managed dengue outbreaks with multiple circulating strains.

Addressing the threat of multiple dengue strain transmission by *Aedes aegypti* in urban Lagos requires an urgent, coordinated, and multi-sectoral approach involving the government, healthcare providers, communities, and research institutions. By implementing these recommendations, Lagos can strengthen its public health resilience and effectively mitigate the impact of this evolving dengue challenge.
