# **Neural Oscillatory Dynamics in the Anterior Cingulate Cortex and Insula During Emotional Autobiographical Speech and Their Interaction with Default Mode-Salience Network Connectivity**

**1\. Introduction**

Neural oscillations, characterized by rhythmic fluctuations in brain activity, serve as a fundamental mechanism orchestrating a wide array of cognitive functions, including the intricate processes of speech and the nuanced experience of emotion 1. These oscillatory patterns, observable across various frequency bands, are thought to underlie the temporal organization of neural activity necessary for complex information processing 2. Among the brain regions critically involved in these functions are the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the insula. The ACC, strategically positioned with connections to both the limbic system and the prefrontal cortex, is implicated in affect regulation and the integration of cognitive and emotional processes 3. The insula, often considered a hub for interoception, plays a significant role in the subjective feeling of emotion and the processing of salient stimuli 4.

Emotional expressivity, the outward manifestation of inner emotional states, varies considerably between individuals and influences how emotions are communicated and experienced 6. Understanding the neurophysiological basis of these individual differences is a key goal in affective neuroscience. Autobiographical memory, the recall of personal past experiences, provides a rich context for examining the interplay between emotion and cognition, as these memories are often imbued with significant emotional content 7. Furthermore, large-scale brain networks, such as the default mode network (DMN) and the salience network (SN), are increasingly recognized for their roles in internal processing and the detection of emotionally relevant information, respectively 9. The DMN, active during rest and introspection, is involved in self-referential thought and memory recall 9. The SN, with key nodes in the anterior insula and ACC, is crucial for identifying salient events and facilitating the switch between the DMN and other networks involved in external attention 5. The functional connectivity between these networks is thought to play a critical role in emotional processing and regulation 11.

This report aims to address the central question of how neural oscillatory patterns in the ACC and insula during speech production differ between individuals with high versus low emotional expressivity when describing a past autobiographical event. Additionally, it will explore whether these differences interact with individual variations in the functional connectivity between the DMN and the SN. By synthesizing current neuroscientific literature, this report seeks to provide a comprehensive overview of the complex neural mechanisms underlying emotional expression in speech within the context of autobiographical memory recall and large-scale brain network dynamics.

**2\. Neural Oscillations in Speech Production**

Neural oscillations are a fundamental characteristic of brain activity, with distinct frequency bands proposed to support various aspects of speech processing and language comprehension 1. These rhythmic fluctuations, spanning from slow delta waves to fast gamma oscillations, are thought to synchronize with different levels of linguistic information in the speech signal 12. For instance, delta and theta oscillations, operating at lower frequencies, have been implicated in processing larger units like words, syntactic structures, and syllables, while faster gamma oscillations are hypothesized to encode the more rapid fluctuations characteristic of phonetic features 13. This hierarchical organization suggests that speech is processed across multiple temporal scales, with slower oscillations potentially modulating faster activity 2. While the ability to produce and comprehend speech is a uniquely human trait, the underlying oscillatory mechanisms may not be entirely specific to language but could reflect more general cognitive functions such as timing, binding, memory, and prediction 1. The study of neural oscillations offers a valuable approach to understanding the cognitive neuropsychology of speech and language, providing insights into the temporal dynamics of neural activity that underlie these complex processes 12.

Research has begun to investigate the role of neural oscillations in specific brain regions involved in speech production, including the anterior cingulate cortex. Theta oscillations in the ACC and frontal cortex have been linked to attentional processes crucial for guiding and monitoring speech 14. Furthermore, it has been proposed that theta oscillations within the ACC could serve as a temporal framework for coordinating local computations necessary for task-relevant aspects of speech production 15. While studies have examined the neural activations associated with the transition from speech planning to execution in a distributed network including frontal regions 16, the specific oscillatory dynamics within the ACC during these phases remain an area of ongoing investigation.

Similarly, neural oscillations within the insula have been shown to be present during speech production. Spontaneous theta and beta oscillations are widespread in the insula and exhibit an organization along its anterior-posterior axis 18. The posterior insula demonstrates robust activity after the onset of articulation, suggesting a role in the later stages of speech production rather than pre-articulatory planning 20. The anterior insula, while showing weaker activation compared to the posterior region, exhibits activity before and during speech, hinting at a potential involvement in earlier stages or more complex aspects of speech processing 21. The insula's role in integrating sensory feedback during speech production, particularly auditory feedback, is also supported by research, suggesting that oscillations in this region might contribute to the sensorimotor control necessary for fluent speech 20.

**3\. The Anterior Cingulate Cortex and Insula in Speech and Emotion**

The anterior cingulate cortex occupies a unique neuroanatomical position, acting as a bridge between the "emotional" limbic system and the "cognitive" prefrontal cortex 3. This strategic connectivity endows the ACC with a critical role in the integration of neuronal circuitry for affect regulation 3. Beyond its involvement in cognitive control, the ACC significantly contributes to emotional processing, including the assignment of emotions to stimuli, the interpretation of emotional cues, and the generation of appropriate emotional responses 23. Notably, the ACC is involved in the vocal expression of emotions, facilitating the translation of internal emotional states into outward vocalizations 23. Its connections to various brain regions implicated in emotion, autonomic functions, memory, and reward highlight its multifaceted role in shaping our emotional experiences and expressions 3.

The insula, often referred to as the fifth lobe of the brain, is a key area for interoception, the perception of internal bodily states, which forms a fundamental basis for the subjective feeling of emotion 4. Activation in the anterior insular cortex is consistently associated with accessing interoceptive information and underpins the conscious experience of emotional states 4. The insula also plays a crucial role in processing emotional salience, acting as a central hub within a neural network that prioritizes emotionally significant stimuli 5. This salience processing is essential for guiding behavior in alignment with personal and interpersonal goals 28. Research indicates that the insula is involved in both the perception and production of emotional speech. For instance, the insula shows activation during the expression of angry prosody 29 and appears to play a role in the integration of auditory and visual cues in emotional speech processing 30. Its involvement in representing arousal levels of emotions further underscores its importance in the neural substrates of emotional experience and expression 4.

**4\. Autobiographical Memory and Emotional Expression**

The recall of past autobiographical events engages a distributed network of brain regions, including both the anterior cingulate cortex and the insula 31. Studies using neuroimaging techniques have shown increased activity in the ACC during the recall of both positive and negative autobiographical memories, suggesting its role in accessing and processing the emotional content of these personal experiences 31. Similarly, the insula has been implicated in autobiographical memory retrieval, particularly for events with strong emotional valence 32. While the precise contribution of the insula to autobiographical memory is still being explored, its extensive connections with other regions known to be involved in this process, such as the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala, suggest a significant role 34. The emotional content of autobiographical memories profoundly influences how these events are remembered and the associated neural activity 7. Autobiographical recall is even frequently used as a method to induce specific emotional states in laboratory settings, highlighting the strong link between memory and emotion 36.

Emotional expressivity, the degree to which individuals outwardly display their emotions, is a relevant factor when considering the neural processing of recalling and describing personal events 6. Research suggests that emotional expressivity, as measured through the emotional content of autobiographies, can even be associated with later cognitive health outcomes 6. When individuals orally recount self-defining memories, which are characterized by their vividness and emotional intensity, their level of emotional expressivity might influence the neural activity in regions like the ACC and insula that are involved in both memory retrieval and emotional processing 8. However, the specific neural oscillatory patterns within these regions during speech about autobiographical events and how they differ based on an individual's emotional expressivity remain a key area for further investigation.

**5\. The Default Mode and Salience Networks**

The default mode network is a large-scale brain network that exhibits heightened activity during periods of rest and when individuals are engaged in internally directed cognitive processes 9. These processes include mind-wandering, self-referential thought, recalling past events, and imagining future scenarios 9. Key regions within the DMN include the medial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, and inferior parietal lobule 41. The DMN is not merely a passive network but is thought to actively integrate incoming external information with prior internal knowledge to create context-dependent models of unfolding situations 39.

In contrast, the salience network plays a crucial role in detecting and filtering stimuli that are salient, whether they originate from the external environment or from within the body 5. The SN is considered a "moderator" that facilitates the switching between the internally focused DMN and the externally oriented central executive network 44. Key regions within the SN include the anterior insula and the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex 5. The SN is sensitive to emotionally relevant events and is proposed to mark such events for further processing, initiating appropriate control signals to guide behavior 5.

The functional connectivity between the DMN and the SN, reflecting the temporal synchrony of their activity, can be measured using techniques such as resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and subsequent correlation analyses 48. This connectivity is relevant to cognitive and emotional processing, as it reflects the dynamic interplay between internally focused thought and the processing of salient information 11. For example, the SN's ability to detect salient emotional cues might influence the activity of the DMN during self-referential tasks like autobiographical recall 11. The strength and nature of this functional connectivity can vary between individuals and may underlie differences in how they process and respond to emotional information.

**6\. Emotional Expressivity and Neural Correlates**

Individual differences in emotional expressivity have been linked to variations in brain activity, particularly in regions involved in emotional processing such as the ACC and insula 53. Research has shown that individuals with high emotional susceptibility exhibit increased activity in the anterior insula when explicitly processing emotional stimuli, compared to those with low emotional susceptibility 56. This suggests that the insula's response to emotional content is modulated by an individual's inherent tendency to experience and express emotions. Furthermore, studies have indicated that neural oscillations, particularly in the theta band, can differentiate between the processing of emotional versus neutral expressions 58. Synchronization of neural oscillations across different frequency bands is also thought to mediate the rapid detection, integration, and evaluation of emotional expressions 54. Specifically within the ACC, oscillatory activity, such as delta-band desynchronization, has been associated with the experience of positive emotions during autobiographical memory recall, with some evidence suggesting gender-specific effects 59. Additionally, diminished beta-band synchronization in the ACC has been observed in episodes of high negative emotion 59. These findings point towards a relationship between specific oscillatory patterns in the ACC and insula and the processing of emotional information, which may vary with an individual's level of emotional expressivity.

The relationship between emotional expressivity and the functional connectivity of large-scale brain networks like the DMN and SN has also been explored 60. Studies have found correlations between emotional empathy scores, a construct related to emotional expressivity, and specific patterns of functional connectivity within the DMN and SN 60. Higher emotional awareness, another facet of emotional processing and expression, has been linked to more efficient information exchange between regions of both the DMN and SN 64. Furthermore, stronger functional connectivity within the SN and between the SN and other networks like the DMN and frontoparietal network has been associated with lower levels of negative affect in stressful situations 62. These findings suggest that individual differences in the way these large-scale networks communicate may underlie variations in emotional expressivity and the processing of emotional experiences.

**7\. The Interplay of Oscillations, Brain Regions, and Networks**

Synthesizing the current understanding of neural oscillations, the roles of the ACC and insula in emotion and speech, and the functions of the DMN and SN, we can propose potential differences in oscillatory patterns during emotional autobiographical speech based on emotional expressivity. Individuals with high emotional expressivity might exhibit increased power or altered frequency of specific oscillations, such as theta or gamma, in the anterior insula during the recounting of emotionally salient autobiographical events 56. This heightened oscillatory activity could reflect a greater engagement of interoceptive processing and emotional salience detection in these individuals. Similarly, differences in delta or beta oscillations within the ACC might be observed, potentially related to the valence and intensity of the emotions expressed, and these differences could be more pronounced in individuals with higher emotional expressivity 59.

The functional connectivity between the DMN and the SN likely plays a modulatory role in these oscillatory patterns. Individuals with higher emotional expressivity might demonstrate stronger functional connectivity between specific nodes of the DMN and SN that also have connections to the ACC and insula 60. This stronger connectivity could facilitate a more efficient integration of self-referential information from the autobiographical memory (processed within the DMN) with the emotional salience of the event (processed within the SN, involving the insula). This enhanced integration could then manifest as more pronounced oscillatory responses in the ACC and insula during the emotional expression in speech. Conversely, individuals with lower emotional expressivity might exhibit weaker DMN-SN connectivity, potentially leading to a less integrated processing of the emotional autobiographical memory and consequently attenuated or different oscillatory patterns in the ACC and insula during speech.

The anterior insula's role as a key component of the SN and its involvement in emotional processing suggest a potential mechanism for this interaction 4. The strength of the functional connection between the anterior insula and regions of the DMN could directly influence the oscillatory activity related to emotional expression. For instance, a stronger AI-DMN connection might lead to greater synchronization or increased power of specific oscillations in the ACC and insula when recalling and speaking about emotionally significant autobiographical events, particularly in individuals who are more emotionally expressive. This could reflect a more robust interplay between the internal representation of the self and the emotional significance of the recalled event, driving a more expressive vocal recounting.

**8\. Discussion and Conclusion**

This report has synthesized current research to explore the potential differences in neural oscillatory patterns in the ACC and insula during speech production about emotional autobiographical events between individuals with high and low emotional expressivity, and the potential modulatory role of DMN-SN functional connectivity. Based on the reviewed literature, it is plausible that individuals with higher emotional expressivity exhibit altered oscillatory dynamics in the anterior insula and ACC, possibly characterized by increased power or frequency in specific bands like theta or gamma, reflecting a greater engagement of emotional processing. Furthermore, the functional connectivity between the DMN and SN likely influences these oscillatory patterns, with stronger connectivity potentially facilitating a more integrated processing of emotional autobiographical memories and leading to more pronounced oscillatory responses during expressive speech.

However, it is important to acknowledge the limitations of the current research. There is a paucity of studies that directly address all aspects of the user's query, particularly those comparing neural oscillations during speech about autobiographical events between individuals with differing levels of emotional expressivity while also examining DMN-SN connectivity. Studying the complex interactions between brain regions, networks, and oscillatory activity presents methodological challenges. The provided snippets, while informative, do not offer direct comparisons between high and low emotional expressivity groups in the specific task described in the query.

Future investigations should aim to directly address these gaps in our understanding. Studies employing neuroimaging techniques like EEG or MEG, which offer high temporal resolution to capture neural oscillations, could compare oscillatory activity in the ACC and insula during the recall and speech production of autobiographical memories between groups of individuals carefully characterized for their emotional expressivity. Incorporating measures of functional connectivity between the DMN and SN, possibly using fMRI, would allow researchers to examine the interaction between network dynamics and local oscillatory patterns. Future research should also explore the specific roles of different oscillatory frequency bands and their interactions, such as cross-frequency coupling, in mediating emotional expression in speech. Techniques like Granger causality could be used to investigate the directionality of influence between the ACC, insula, DMN, and SN during this complex cognitive and emotional task.

In conclusion, understanding the neurophysiological basis of emotional expression in speech is a complex endeavor that requires considering the interplay of local brain region activity, large-scale network dynamics, and individual differences. Future research that directly investigates the interaction between neural oscillations in the ACC and insula, DMN-SN functional connectivity, and emotional expressivity during autobiographical recall and speech will be crucial for further elucidating the neural mechanisms underlying how we communicate our emotional past.
