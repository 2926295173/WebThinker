# **Potential Cascading Effects of the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan Pipeline Expansion on the Asiatic Cheetah in the Southeastern Greater Caucasus Mountains**

**1\. Executive Summary:**

This report analyzes the potential negative ecological consequences stemming from the planned expansion of the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) pipeline, with a specific focus on the critically endangered Asiatic cheetah within the southeastern foothills of the Greater Caucasus Mountains. While the current distribution of this subspecies is limited to Iran, this analysis considers the historical presence of the cheetah in the Caucasus and the potential for future conservation initiatives in the region. The primary concerns addressed are the increased risk of human-wildlife conflict and the degradation of habitat due to infrastructure development associated with the pipeline's expansion. The report synthesizes available information regarding the pipeline, the cheetah's historical and current status, and the general ecological impacts of pipeline projects to assess the potential cascading effects. Findings suggest that the expansion, even if primarily focused on increased throughput, could lead to habitat fragmentation, degradation, and increased human encroachment, thereby posing risks to the ecological integrity of a region that could be important for the long-term survival of the Asiatic cheetah. The report concludes with recommendations for comprehensive environmental impact assessments, mitigation strategies, and long-term monitoring to minimize potential adverse effects.

**2\. Introduction:**

The Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) pipeline represents a significant piece of energy infrastructure, designed to transport crude oil from the Caspian region to the Mediterranean Sea, bypassing environmentally sensitive waterways like the Turkish Straits 1. This extensive pipeline, approximately 1,768 kilometers in length, traverses Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Turkey, originating near Baku and terminating at the Ceyhan Marine Terminal 2. The project was conceived to facilitate the export of oil from the Azeri-Chirag-Gunashli oil field in Azerbaijan and to provide an alternative export route for other Caspian oil fields 1. Operational since 2006, with an initial capacity of one million barrels per day, the pipeline underwent expansion work in 2009 to increase its capacity to 1.2 million barrels per day through the injection of drag-reducing agents 2. The construction of the BTC pipeline involved a consortium of major oil companies, led by BP, with financial backing from international institutions such as the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and the International Finance Corporation (IFC), alongside various governmental agencies and commercial banks 1. The project was viewed as a crucial development for unlocking the economic potential of the Caspian region, promising financial, environmental, political, and social benefits for Azerbaijan and Georgia 1. Notably, the initial project proponents emphasized the application of high international environmental and technical standards during construction and operation 1. Comprehensive environmental and social studies were undertaken, resulting in various management plans aimed at mitigating potential negative impacts 1.

Recent developments indicate a planned increase in the utilization of the BTC pipeline, driven by Kazakhstan's interest in diversifying its oil export routes 3. Kazakhstan's national oil company, KazMunayGas, has signed an agreement with Azerbaijan's SOCAR to transport oil through the BTC pipeline, with potential volumes reaching up to 20 million tons annually in the coming years 7. This increased throughput, while not necessarily involving the construction of a completely new pipeline in the Caucasus region, could necessitate upgrades or expansions to associated infrastructure, such as pump stations, storage facilities, and access roads, within the existing pipeline corridor. The southeastern foothills of the Greater Caucasus Mountains, a region traversed by the BTC pipeline, are the specific geographical focus of this analysis.

The Asiatic cheetah (*Acinonyx jubatus venaticus*) is a critically endangered subspecies of cheetah that once ranged across a vast territory from the Arabian Peninsula and the Near East to the Caspian region, Transcaucasus, Central Asia, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and India 8. Tragically, during the 20th century, the Asiatic cheetah was extirpated from most of its former range, with the only known surviving population now residing in the arid and semi-arid regions of Iran 8. Current estimates suggest a perilously small population size, with some reports indicating fewer than 50 individuals remaining in the wild 8. The primary threats to the Asiatic cheetah's survival include habitat loss and fragmentation, prey depletion, human persecution, and road accidents 9.

Given the planned expansion of the BTC pipeline through a region that was historically part of the Asiatic cheetah's range, this report will analyze the potential cascading effects of this development on the fragmented habitats of the species, with a particular emphasis on the southeastern foothills of the Greater Caucasus Mountains. The analysis will focus on the potential for increased human-wildlife conflict and habitat degradation resulting from the expansion and its associated infrastructure. While the Asiatic cheetah is not currently known to inhabit this specific area, the ecological integrity of the region and its potential for future conservation efforts warrant careful consideration of these potential impacts.

**3\. Current Status of the Asiatic Cheetah in the Southeastern Greater Caucasus:**

The historical distribution of the Asiatic cheetah encompassed a vast area, including the Caucasus region 8. Evidence, though potentially limited to broader historical records, suggests that the southeastern foothills of the Greater Caucasus Mountains would have likely fallen within this historical range, forming a part of the Transcaucasian distribution 8. However, due to a combination of factors, including intensive hunting, habitat destruction through agricultural expansion, and prey depletion, the Asiatic cheetah has been extirpated from the Caucasus region 8. The last confirmed sightings in Central Asia, bordering the Caucasus, occurred several decades ago, highlighting the severity of the population decline in this part of its former range 10.

Currently, the Asiatic cheetah's habitat is confined to the desert areas around Dasht-e Kavir in the eastern half of Iran 9. These cheetahs primarily inhabit open lands, small plains, semi-desert areas, and other open habitats where their prey, such as goitered gazelles, wild sheep, and wild goats, are available 9. Within Iran, the remaining populations are fragmented, largely confined to protected areas like Kavir National Park, Touran National Park, and Bafq Protected Area 9. This fragmentation is a significant threat to their long-term survival, primarily driven by human activities 9. The construction of roads, for instance, has been a major factor in dividing cheetah habitats, isolating small populations and increasing the risk of roadkill, which accounts for a significant number of cheetah deaths annually 12. Similarly, agricultural expansion and mining activities have led to habitat loss and further fragmentation, reducing the available space for cheetahs and their prey 9. The need for cheetahs to cover vast distances in search of prey, with some individuals observed traveling over 200 kilometers within a few months, underscores the critical importance of maintaining habitat connectivity 12.

Even in the absence of a current Asiatic cheetah population in the southeastern Greater Caucasus, the region faces existing threats to its biodiversity that could be exacerbated by the BTC pipeline expansion 16. Illegal logging and the harvesting of fuelwood contribute to forest degradation, impacting habitat suitability for various species 16. Overgrazing by livestock leads to habitat degradation and erosion, potentially reducing the availability of suitable grazing land for wild ungulates, which could serve as prey for cheetahs if they were to return 16. Poaching and the illegal wildlife trade also pose significant threats to the region's fauna 16. Furthermore, existing infrastructure development, including roads, dams, and other pipelines, has already contributed to habitat fragmentation and loss in the Caucasus 16. Therefore, any additional infrastructure associated with the BTC pipeline expansion could act as a compounding factor, further fragmenting habitats and potentially hindering future conservation efforts for large carnivores in the region. The presence of other threatened large carnivores in the Caucasus, such as the leopard, which faces threats from habitat fragmentation, highlights the vulnerability of this ecosystem to infrastructure development 18.

**4\. Potential Impacts of the BTC Pipeline Expansion:**

The planned expansion of the BTC pipeline, primarily aimed at increasing the volume of oil transported, could lead to several potential impacts on the environment of the southeastern Greater Caucasus Mountains, even if direct new pipeline construction is limited. These impacts could have cascading effects on the ecological integrity of the region and potentially affect the suitability of the area for the future return or reintroduction of the Asiatic cheetah.

Habitat fragmentation is a significant concern. While the existing pipeline is buried along its length 2, the expansion to handle increased oil flow might necessitate the development or upgrading of associated infrastructure. This could include the construction of new or expanded access roads for maintenance and operation, the establishment or enlargement of pump stations to facilitate increased flow rates, and potentially the creation of additional worker camps to support these activities. These developments can act as barriers to wildlife movement, dividing contiguous habitats into smaller, isolated patches 16. For large carnivores like the Asiatic cheetah, which require extensive home ranges to find sufficient prey 12, such fragmentation can severely limit their ability to move between critical resources, find mates, and maintain healthy populations. The experience in Iran, where roads have fragmented cheetah habitat and led to fatal collisions, underscores the potential negative consequences of increased linear infrastructure in a region that could serve as future cheetah habitat 12.

Habitat degradation is another potential consequence. The construction and maintenance of expanded infrastructure can lead to the loss of vegetation along the pipeline corridor and in the vicinity of associated facilities 20. Increased vehicular traffic and construction activities can cause soil erosion and compaction, affecting soil health and the regeneration of native plant species 16. Furthermore, the risk of pollution could increase with the intensification of pipeline operations and the potential for spills or leaks. Although the initial Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) for the BTC pipeline claimed a low risk of oil spills 21, environmental organizations raised concerns about the adequacy of these assessments and the potential for devastating consequences in sensitive areas 22. The pipeline's route through Borjomi National Park in Georgia, a critical source of mineral water, highlighted the potential for significant environmental and economic damage from a spill 23. Habitat degradation can also indirectly impact the Asiatic cheetah by affecting its prey species. Loss of grazing land due to construction, pollution, or increased human disturbance could lead to a decline in the populations of wild ungulates that form the cheetah's primary food source 9.

The expansion could also lead to increased human encroachment into previously remote areas. The development of new access roads and the presence of worker camps can facilitate easier human access to areas that might otherwise be relatively undisturbed and potentially suitable for wildlife 9. This increased human presence can lead to habitat disturbance through noise, light pollution, and other forms of human activity, potentially making these areas less suitable for sensitive species. Furthermore, easier access can increase the risk of poaching, both of potential future cheetah populations and their prey, which is already a significant threat to biodiversity in the Caucasus region 9.

Elevated human-wildlife conflict is a further potential risk. With increased human presence and activity in areas that could serve as cheetah habitat, the likelihood of encounters between humans and cheetahs (if present or reintroduced) could rise. Habitat loss and fragmentation can also lead to increased overlap between wildlife habitats and human settlements or grazing areas. This can increase the risk of cheetahs preying on livestock, which is a major cause of human-wildlife conflict and retaliatory killings of cheetahs in Iran 9. Given the critically endangered status of the Asiatic cheetah, any increase in human-caused mortality, including retaliatory killings, could have severe consequences for the subspecies' survival.

**5\. Review of Existing Environmental Impact Assessments:**

The initial Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) pipeline project was subject to Environmental and Social Impact Assessments (ESIAs) to evaluate its potential effects 1. It is important to note that three separate ESIAs were conducted, one for each of the countries the pipeline traverses (Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Turkey), by different consultants 5. This approach led to variations in the quality and contributed to the complexity of the overall assessment process 5. While these assessments did consider the potential impact on wildlife habitats 1, specific details regarding the potential effects on large carnivores, particularly the Asiatic cheetah (even considering its historical presence), are not readily apparent in the provided snippets. The focus of the initial assessments appeared to be broader, encompassing a range of environmental issues such as routing options, surface and groundwater impacts, and sensitive flora and fauna habitats 1.

Despite the completion of these ESIAs and the development of Environmental and Social Action Plans 1, the BTC project faced criticism from environmental organizations regarding the adequacy and scope of the assessments 22. Concerns were raised about the routing of the pipeline through sensitive areas, such as the Borjomi National Park in Georgia, without sufficient investigation into alternatives 22. The lack of a Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) was also highlighted as a deficiency 25. Additionally, some organizations questioned the quality of the ESIAs, the thoroughness of public consultation processes, and the transparency of the project 5. For instance, it was alleged that the environmental review process for the Turkish section of the pipeline was conducted rapidly, potentially overlooking sensitive sites 23.

The history of the initial BTC pipeline project underscores the importance of rigorous and independent environmental assessments, especially when dealing with large-scale infrastructure projects that traverse ecologically sensitive regions. The criticisms leveled against the initial ESIAs suggest that a thorough and transparent assessment of the potential impacts of the current expansion is crucial. This assessment should specifically address the potential cascading effects on biodiversity in the southeastern foothills of the Greater Caucasus Mountains, including the potential future habitat for the Asiatic cheetah and other large carnivores present in the region, such as the leopard 18.

The provided research material does not contain specific examples of environmental impacts from similar pipeline projects on large carnivores in the Caucasus or adjacent regions. Therefore, further research beyond these snippets would be necessary to identify relevant case studies and lessons learned from other pipeline developments in comparable ecosystems. Such research could provide valuable insights into the types of impacts that might be anticipated and the effectiveness of various mitigation measures.

**6\. Impact on Current Conservation Efforts:**

Current conservation efforts for the Asiatic cheetah are primarily focused within Iran, where the last remaining population resides 11. Organizations like the Iranian Cheetah Society are actively involved in research, habitat protection, and raising awareness about the critically endangered status of the subspecies 12. These efforts often involve securing and managing protected areas, mitigating human-wildlife conflict, and working to maintain habitat connectivity between fragmented populations 12. However, conservationists face significant challenges, including limited funding, the impacts of international sanctions on project implementation, and the ongoing threats of poaching, habitat loss, and prey depletion 15. The small size of the remaining cheetah population and its low genetic diversity further compound the challenges 12.

Even though the Asiatic cheetah is currently absent from the southeastern foothills of the Greater Caucasus Mountains, the planned expansion of the BTC pipeline in this region could indirectly affect long-term conservation prospects for the species. If the expansion leads to habitat degradation and fragmentation in this area, it could diminish the potential for future reintroduction efforts, should conditions become favorable. The historical presence of the cheetah in the Caucasus suggests that the region might once have been suitable habitat, and maintaining its ecological integrity is important for any future conservation strategies that might consider re-establishing populations outside of Iran.

Furthermore, the pipeline expansion could impact conservation efforts for other large carnivores currently present in the Caucasus, such as the leopard 18. These species face similar threats from habitat fragmentation, human encroachment, and increased human-wildlife conflict. Any development that exacerbates these threats could have negative consequences for the overall biodiversity of the region, including species that might serve as ecological indicators for the potential future presence of cheetahs. The need to preserve corridors between fragmented habitats is crucial for the long-term survival of many species in the Caucasus 14. The BTC pipeline expansion, if not carefully planned and mitigated, could further disrupt these vital connections, undermining broader conservation goals for the region's fauna.

**7\. Recommendations:**

To minimize the potential negative cascading effects of the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) pipeline expansion on the ecological integrity of the southeastern foothills of the Greater Caucasus Mountains and to safeguard any potential for the future return of the Asiatic cheetah, the following recommendations are proposed:

* **Conduct a Comprehensive and Independent Environmental Impact Assessment:** A thorough and independent EIA must be undertaken specifically to evaluate the potential impacts of the pipeline expansion and its associated infrastructure on the biodiversity of the southeastern Greater Caucasus. This assessment should go beyond the scope of the initial ESIAs and specifically address the potential effects on large carnivores, including an analysis of potential future habitat for the Asiatic cheetah based on historical data and ecological requirements. The assessment should be transparent and involve input from independent ecological experts and conservation organizations.  
* **Detailed Habitat Mapping and Connectivity Analysis:** Detailed mapping of potential Asiatic cheetah habitat (based on historical distribution and ecological suitability) in the southeastern Caucasus should be conducted. This should be followed by a thorough analysis of how the pipeline expansion and associated infrastructure could potentially disrupt existing or future wildlife corridors. Based on this analysis, concrete measures should be recommended to maintain or restore ecological connectivity across the pipeline corridor.  
* **Minimize Infrastructure Footprint:** All feasible options should be explored to minimize the physical footprint of any new infrastructure associated with the pipeline expansion. This includes optimizing the design and location of access roads, pump stations, and worker camps to reduce habitat disturbance. Existing infrastructure should be utilized wherever possible, and best practices in construction and operation should be implemented to minimize environmental impacts.  
* **Implement Stringent Mitigation Measures:** Robust mitigation measures must be developed and implemented to address potential habitat degradation. This includes comprehensive erosion control measures during construction and operation, strict protocols for pollution prevention and waste management, and a detailed plan for the restoration of any disturbed areas using native plant species appropriate for the local ecosystem and suitable for potential cheetah prey.  
* **Human-Wildlife Conflict Prevention Strategies:** Proactive strategies to prevent human-wildlife conflict should be developed and implemented in collaboration with local communities and conservation experts. This could include awareness programs for pipeline workers and local residents, measures to protect livestock from potential predation (even by other large carnivores as a proxy), and clear protocols for reporting and responding to any wildlife encounters in a way that prioritizes both human safety and wildlife conservation.  
* **Long-Term Monitoring Program:** A comprehensive long-term monitoring program should be established to assess the actual impacts of the pipeline expansion on the region's biodiversity. This program should include regular wildlife surveys, the use of camera trapping to monitor the presence and movement of large carnivores, and ongoing assessments of habitat quality and connectivity. The data collected through this monitoring program should be used to adapt and refine mitigation measures as needed, ensuring an adaptive management approach.  
* **Transparency and Stakeholder Engagement:** Transparency should be maintained throughout all stages of the pipeline expansion project, including the environmental impact assessment process, the development and implementation of mitigation measures, and the findings of the long-term monitoring program. Regular engagement with local communities, conservation organizations, and independent experts is crucial to address concerns, incorporate valuable input, and build trust in the project's commitment to environmental responsibility.  
* **Explore Offset Mechanisms:** If the environmental impact assessment identifies significant unavoidable negative impacts on potential Asiatic cheetah habitat or regional biodiversity, appropriate biodiversity offset mechanisms should be explored. These could include supporting existing conservation initiatives for the Asiatic cheetah in Iran or investing in habitat restoration and protection projects within the southeastern Caucasus region to compensate for any residual losses.

**8\. Conclusion:**

The Asiatic cheetah remains on the brink of extinction, and the preservation of its remaining habitat and the potential for future range expansion are critical for its long-term survival. While the southeastern foothills of the Greater Caucasus Mountains do not currently harbor a cheetah population, their historical significance and potential for future conservation efforts warrant careful consideration of any developments that could impact the region's ecological integrity. The planned expansion of the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline presents potential risks of increased human-wildlife conflict and habitat degradation through fragmentation and other forms of disturbance. To mitigate these risks, it is imperative that a comprehensive and independent environmental impact assessment is conducted, followed by the implementation of stringent mitigation measures, proactive conflict prevention strategies, and a long-term monitoring program. Transparency and active engagement with all stakeholders are essential to ensure that this development proceeds in a manner that minimizes negative impacts on this fragile ecosystem and safeguards the potential for the future return of the Asiatic cheetah to its historical range. A balanced approach that integrates economic development with a strong commitment to biodiversity conservation is crucial for the long-term sustainability of both the region and its unique natural heritage.
