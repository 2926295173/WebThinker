# **Evolutionary Modifications for Suction Feeding in a Descendant of Early Tetrapods**

**1\. Introduction**

Suction feeding represents a highly effective strategy for aquatic prey capture that has evolved independently across a diverse range of vertebrate lineages. This mechanism, which relies on the rapid expansion of the buccal cavity to generate sub-ambient pressure and draw water and prey into the mouth, showcases a remarkable convergence driven by the physical properties of the aquatic environment 1. The shared patterns observed in the timing and sequence of head movements during suction feeding across phylogenetically distant groups like fishes, salamanders, and turtles underscore the fundamental hydrodynamic constraints imposed by water as a feeding medium 1.

The Late Devonian and Early Carboniferous periods witnessed the pivotal transition of vertebrates from aquatic to terrestrial life, with early tetrapods such as *Tiktaalik roseae* and *Pederpes finneyae* occupying crucial positions in this evolutionary narrative 4. These transitional fossils exhibit a fascinating mosaic of fish-like and tetrapod-like characteristics, providing invaluable insights into the morphological and ecological changes associated with the colonization of land 4.

In contrast to the likely feeding mechanisms of these early tetrapods, which may have involved biting or a combination of biting and limited suction, modern pipid frogs (family Pipidae) represent a lineage of tetrapods that have secondarily returned to a fully aquatic lifestyle and evolved a highly specialized suction feeding mechanism 1. This adaptation allows them to efficiently capture prey underwater without the use of a tongue, a characteristic feature of most other frogs 1. The morphological adaptations that underpin this suction feeding in pipids, particularly those involving the hyoid apparatus and mandible, stand in stark contrast to the ancestral condition observed in early tetrapods.

This report aims to delineate the specific evolutionary modifications to the hyoid apparatus and mandibular morphology that would be necessary for a hypothetical, tetrapod-like descendant of *Tiktaalik* or *Pederpes* to achieve the same level of suction feeding efficiency as modern-day pipid frogs, considering the existing fossil record of early tetrapod evolution. The significant divergence in feeding strategies between early tetrapods and pipid frogs suggests a substantial evolutionary journey involving notable transformations in the feeding apparatus.

**2\. The Mechanics of Suction Feeding in Pipid Frogs**

The fundamental principle of suction feeding across aquatic vertebrates involves a rapid increase in the volume of the buccal cavity, which results in a decrease in intraoral pressure 1. This pressure differential generates a flow of water into the mouth, drawing the prey along with it 2. Water, being a dense and viscous medium, plays a crucial role in this prey capture mechanism, and aquatic organisms often exploit its hydrodynamic properties to their advantage 1.

In pipid frogs, the hyoid apparatus plays a central role in generating the suction force. Posteroventral motion of the hyoid is the primary mechanism for increasing the buccal volume 1. Some pipid species, such as *Pipa pipa*, employ a bidirectional suction mechanism that involves both depression of the hyoid and retraction of the clavicle 14. Notably, in *Pipa pipa*, the hyoid apparatus is uniquely arranged; it is not connected to the skull and is enclosed by the pectoral girdle, with the major retractor muscles originating from the femur 17. This detachment of the hyoid from the skull and its connection to the pectoral girdle and even the femur signifies a considerable departure from the typical tetrapod hyoid arrangement. This unique morphology likely facilitates the extensive buccal expansion required for their specialized suction feeding.

The mandibular morphology and movement in pipids are also adapted for suction feeding. These frogs typically exhibit a wide gape, allowing for the intake of large volumes of water 1. A defining characteristic of pipids is the absence of a tongue, which necessitates their reliance on suction for prey capture 1. Some pipids, like *Hymenochirus boettgeri*, possess edentulous jaws 1, further emphasizing their reliance on engulfing prey rather than grasping or manipulating it with teeth. Oral flaps that laterally occlude the gape may also contribute to creating an effective seal for suction generation 1.

While the hyoid and mandible are key components, other structures also contribute to the efficiency of suction feeding in pipids. Lateral head expansion can further increase buccal volume 1. In *Pipa pipa*, the depression of the ventral pectoral girdle actively enlarges the volume of the anterior trunk, contributing to the continued movement of entrained water 14. Although some pipids like *Xenopus* and *Pipa* use their forelimbs for scooping or corralling prey, others such as *Hymenochirus* and *Pseudhymenochirus* rely solely on inertial suction for prey capture 2.

The kinematics of suction feeding in pipids follows a conserved rostrocaudal sequence, with mouth opening preceding hyoid depression and mouth closing 1. In some species, like *Hymenochirus*, maximum hyoid depression occurs after mouth closure, potentially prolonging the caudal flow of water to effectively entrain prey 15. Suction events are often preceded by a body lunge towards the food item and followed by recoil 15.

The suction feeding mechanism in pipid frogs, while adhering to the general principles observed across aquatic vertebrates, showcases a highly derived and varied set of adaptations. The specialization is particularly evident in the morphology and function of the hyoid apparatus, its unique interaction with the pectoral girdle and axial skeleton in some species, and the adaptations of the mandible for efficient underwater prey capture in the absence of a tongue.

**3\. Hyoid Apparatus and Mandibular Morphology of *Tiktaalik* and *Pederpes*: An Overview from the Fossil Record**

The fossil record of *Tiktaalik roseae*, a tetrapodomorph fish from the Late Devonian period, provides valuable insights into the morphology of its feeding apparatus.

The ventral elements of the branchial skeleton, which include the hyoid apparatus, are known for *Tiktaalik* 19. This apparatus comprises two basibranchials, a urohyal, right and left hypohyals and ceratohyals, hypobranchials for the first three arches, and ceratobranchials for four arches 19. The larger, more rostral of the two basibranchials (basibranchial 1\) possesses articulations for the hypohyals and the hypobranchials of the first two arches, as well as the second basibranchial 19. The shape of this first basibranchial is octagonal, a feature shared with *Gogonasus andrewsae* and *Medoevia lata*, but distinct from the longer, more rectangular element found in *Mandageria fairfaxi* and *Eusthenopteron foordi* 19. The second basibranchial in *Tiktaalik* is arched and appears to articulate with the third arch hypobranchials 19. The urohyal fits into the ventral concavity of the second basibranchial and a depression on the first, and it is characterized by a deep midsagittal crest 19. The ceratobranchials of *Tiktaalik* are deeply grooved, a morphology similar to that observed in *Gogonasus*, *Eusthenopteron*, and *Acanthostega gunnari* 19. Additionally, the hyomandibula of *Tiktaalik* is notable for being short and straight, contrasting with the boomerang-shaped element found in more basal finned tetrapodomorphs 19. This hyomandibula is oriented horizontally, similar to *Panderichthys rhombolepis* 19. Its articulation with the braincase occurs along a single, strap-shaped surface on the distal edge of the lateral commissure, unlike the condition in other finned tetrapodomorphs which exhibit separate dorsal and ventral facets 19. Notably, the hyomandibula of *Tiktaalik* does not articulate with the palatoquadrate, suggesting that cartilaginous elements might have connected it to the ventral hyoid elements 19. *Tiktaalik* also lacks an ossified operculum 19. The morphology of *Tiktaalik*'s hyoid apparatus reflects its transitional nature, retaining features associated with branchial arches while exhibiting derived characteristics like the short, straight hyomandibula.

The mandibular morphology of *Tiktaalik* is consistent with that of a primitive sarcopterygian 7. Compared to more derived tetrapodomorphs, its lower jaw exhibits a plesiomorphic morphology 20. Uniquely, *Tiktaalik* possesses up to five rows of teeth, a feature that is absent in both its presumed fish ancestors and the tetrapods into which it is thought to have evolved 6. The skull of *Tiktaalik* was capable of both biting and snapping, and evidence suggests the presence of cranial kinesis and the potential for suction generation 21. Lateral sliding joints between the cheek and dermal skull roof, along with independent mobility between the hyomandibula and palatoquadrate, would have allowed for lateral expansion of the suspensorium, similar to modern alligator gars and polypterids 22. This movement could have expanded the spiracular and opercular cavities, directing fluid through the feeding apparatus 22. Recent analyses suggest that *Tiktaalik*'s feeding style may have resembled that of alligator gars and crocodiles, involving lateral snapping 8. While the cranial kinesis might have facilitated some level of suction feeding, the presence of multiple tooth rows and a robust jaw structure indicate that biting was likely a significant component of its feeding strategy.

Information regarding the hyoid apparatus of *Pederpes finneyae*, an early Carboniferous tetrapod, is limited in the provided material. The snippets primarily focus on the hyoid apparatus of other tetrapod groups like turtles, mammals, and xenarthrans 18. One snippet mentions that *Pederpes* has a narrow skull 28, which might indirectly suggest a certain size or shape of the hyoid apparatus, potentially related to throat pumping for respiration, a mechanism associated with narrow skulls in some tetrapods 5. However, detailed morphological descriptions of the hyoid apparatus of *Pederpes* are not available in the provided research snippets. This lack of detailed information highlights a gap in our current understanding of this aspect of *Pederpes*'s anatomy.

The mandibular morphology of *Pederpes* shares similarities with *Whatcheeria deltae*, a slightly later Carboniferous tetrapod 5. The holotype specimen of *Pederpes* includes a right lower jaw, although its outer face is badly eroded, and the inner face is visible only in section 30. The left lower jaw lacks its outer face, with the prearticular preserved largely as a natural mold 30. The elongate dentary appears to be the primary tooth-bearing element in the *Pederpes* mandible 32. A massive adsymphyseal ossification forms a significant portion of the mandibular symphysis, and a single coronoid bone is present 32. The angular is extensive in lateral view but lacks a lingual lamina, exhibiting an edge-to-edge contact with the prearticular 32. The prearticular occupies most of the posteromedial surface of the jaw, and a small Meckelian foramen is present 32. The articular is located in the posterodorsal portion of the jaw and features a dorsal, hook-like process on its posterior surface, lacking a retroarticular process 32. A second, blade-like Meckelian ossification is found inside the jaw anterior to the articular 32. Notably, a series of pits along the angular connect to an at least partially enclosed mandibular lateral line canal 32. The mandibular morphology of *Pederpes*, characterized by a dominant toothed dentary and the presence of multiple other bony elements, indicates a jaw structure adapted for biting. The presence of a lateral line canal suggests that *Pederpes* still retained aquatic sensory capabilities.

**4\. Comparative Morphology: Pipid Frogs vs. Early Tetrapods**

A comparison of the hyoid apparatus reveals significant differences between pipid frogs and the early tetrapod *Tiktaalik*. Pipid frogs possess a highly ossified hyobranchial skeleton that is adapted for extensive and rapid depression and retraction, crucial for generating the suction force 1. In *Pipa pipa*, this apparatus exhibits a unique adaptation by being detached from the skull and linked to the pectoral girdle and femur, allowing for a greater degree of mobility and contribution to trunk expansion during suction 17. In contrast, the hyoid apparatus of *Tiktaalik* consists of multiple bony elements related to the branchial arches, with a short, straight hyomandibula that does not articulate with the palatoquadrate 19. While likely involved in supporting gills and potentially some level of buccal expansion, the *Tiktaalik* hyoid appears far more constrained in its potential for movement compared to the specialized hyoid of pipid frogs. The unique connection to the pectoral girdle and femur observed in *Pipa* is entirely absent in *Tiktaalik*. The fundamental differences in hyoid structure and articulation highlight the evolutionary distance and the distinct selective pressures that have shaped these lineages.

Detailed information on the hyoid apparatus of *Pederpes* is lacking in the provided material, making a direct comparison challenging. However, the narrow skull of *Pederpes* has been suggested to correlate with a breathing mechanism involving throat pumping 5. If this is the case, the hyoid apparatus of *Pederpes* might have been adapted for movements associated with this type of respiration, which would likely differ from the rapid depression and retraction characteristic of suction feeding in pipids.

The mandibular morphology also presents a clear contrast between pipid frogs and the early tetrapods. Pipid frogs often have edentulous jaws, as seen in *Hymenochirus*, or possess reduced dentition, reflecting an adaptation for creating a sealed buccal cavity necessary for suction 1. A wide gape is a crucial feature in pipids to facilitate the intake of a large volume of water during suction feeding 1. *Tiktaalik*, on the other hand, retains multiple rows of teeth and a robust jaw structure that is clearly suited for biting and snapping prey 6. While *Tiktaalik* may have possessed some degree of cranial kinesis that could contribute to suction, its mandible is primarily adapted for grasping and potentially manipulating prey, a stark contrast to the engulfing feeding style of pipids. Similarly, *Pederpes* possesses an elongate dentary with teeth and other bony elements in the lower jaw, indicating a biting mechanism 32. Like *Tiktaalik*, the mandibular structure of *Pederpes* is not adapted for the specialized suction feeding observed in pipids. The presence of teeth and multiple ossifications in the mandibles of both early tetrapods point towards a feeding strategy involving biting and manipulation, which differs fundamentally from the suction-based feeding of pipids.

**5\. Hypothetical Modifications for Enhanced Suction Feeding**

For a hypothetical descendant of *Tiktaalik* or *Pederpes* to achieve the level of suction feeding efficiency seen in modern pipid frogs, significant modifications to both the hyoid apparatus and mandibular morphology would be necessary.

The hyoid apparatus would require substantial changes in bone shape and size. The basibranchial elements would likely need to elongate and flatten, providing a broader base for muscle attachment and supporting a larger buccal cavity floor. The ceratobranchials, primarily associated with gill arches, might be reduced or lost, as they are not directly involved in pipid suction feeding 19. The hypohyals and ceratohyals would likely need to undergo significant enlargement and strengthening to enable powerful depression and retraction of the hyoid. The urohyal could evolve into a more robust structure with expanded lateral processes to allow for increased muscle attachment. This transformation would shift the primary function of the hyoid from gill support towards a more plate-like structure capable of extensive vertical movement, analogous to the hyobranchial plate found in modern frogs.

The evolution of new elements within the hyoid apparatus could further enhance the lever system for hyoid movement, potentially resembling the alary processes seen in some frogs. Crucially, the muscle attachment sites on the hyoid elements would need to shift and expand to accommodate the development of powerful depressor and retractor muscles. Furthermore, new muscle attachments might evolve, linking the hyoid apparatus to the pectoral girdle and potentially the axial skeleton, similar to the arrangement in *Pipa pipa*, to facilitate trunk expansion during suction 14. Achieving pipid-level suction would necessitate a radical reorganization of the musculature associated with the hyoid, including the development of novel muscle attachments and potentially the loss of ancestral ones related to gill function.

The mandibular morphology would also require significant alterations. The jaw shape would need to broaden and flatten to create a wider gape and a larger oral cavity. A reduction in the length of the mandibular symphysis could allow for greater independent movement of the lower jaw rami, potentially aiding in buccal cavity expansion. The anterior mandible might evolve a more rounded or scoop-shaped form to facilitate the intake of water. Perhaps the most significant change would be the loss of or a substantial reduction in teeth to eliminate any obstruction to water flow and prey engulfment 1. Instead of teeth, the descendant might develop palatal ridges, similar to those found in toothless toads 33, which could aid in manipulating prey once captured. Additionally, the evolution of cartilaginous or bony extensions to the mandible that could support oral flaps for laterally sealing the gape during suction, as seen in *Hymenochirus*, would likely be necessary 1.

**6\. Evolutionary Plausibility and Constraints**

Considering the evolutionary plausibility of these hypothetical modifications, the fossil record indicates a general trend of increasing ossification and complexity in the hyobranchial apparatus during the evolution of amphibians 18. This trend suggests that the development of a highly ossified hyoid structure in a *Tiktaalik*\-like descendant is plausible. However, the unique detachment of the hyoid from the skull and its linkage to the pectoral girdle and femur seen in *Pipa pipa* represents a significant evolutionary innovation, the likelihood of which is harder to predict. The reduction or loss of ceratobranchials would align with the evolutionary trend in tetrapods where gill-related structures are typically reduced or modified for other functions.

In terms of mandibular morphology, the reduction or loss of teeth has occurred in various tetrapod lineages, including modern amphibians, indicating that this modification is evolutionarily feasible. Broadening of the jaw and changes in the mandibular symphysis are also observed in tetrapod evolution in response to different feeding strategies. The development of oral flaps, being a soft-tissue adaptation, is more difficult to assess based on the fossil record alone. However, the presence of such structures in extant suction-feeding amphibians suggests that their evolution is possible.

Despite these points of plausibility, several evolutionary constraints must be considered. The developmental pathways governing the formation of the hyoid apparatus and mandible are complex and highly conserved. Significant modifications would likely require substantial changes in these developmental programs, which could be constrained by the underlying genetic architecture and potential pleiotropic effects. Furthermore, the coordinated evolution of both the hyoid and mandible, along with the associated musculature and neural control, would be essential for the development of an effective suction feeding mechanism. This requirement for coordinated evolution across multiple systems could represent a significant constraint. The interconnectedness of developmental pathways implies that changes in one structure, such as the hyoid, could have cascading effects on other related structures, like the mandible and the muscles that operate both. The evolution of a complex feeding mechanism like the suction feeding seen in pipids likely demands a series of coordinated evolutionary steps, each of which must provide some selective advantage. The radical departure from a biting-based feeding strategy to a suction-based one, especially involving the loss of teeth which are often crucial for prey capture in aquatic environments, would require strong selective pressures favoring suction feeding.

**7\. Conclusion**

Achieving the level of suction feeding efficiency observed in modern pipid frogs would necessitate a suite of substantial evolutionary modifications to the hyoid apparatus and mandibular morphology of a *Tiktaalik*\-like or *Pederpes*\-like descendant. The hyoid apparatus would likely require a transformation towards a more robust, plate-like structure with enhanced mobility, potentially involving the loss of gill-related elements and the development of novel muscle attachments to the pectoral girdle and axial skeleton. The mandible would need to evolve a broader shape with a wider gape, accompanied by a significant reduction or complete loss of teeth and the possible development of oral flaps for sealing the buccal cavity.

The evolutionary journey from an early tetrapod adapted for a potentially semi-aquatic lifestyle with biting capabilities to a highly specialized aquatic suction feeder like a pipid frog represents a significant undertaking. While the fossil record reveals trends in tetrapod evolution that could make some of these modifications plausible, the degree of specialization seen in pipid suction feeding, particularly the unique hyoid arrangement in some species, highlights the magnitude of the evolutionary changes required. The coordinated evolution of multiple anatomical systems, coupled with potential developmental constraints, underscores the complexity of such a transformation. Future research could benefit from detailed biomechanical modeling to assess the functional implications of the proposed intermediate forms and further investigation into the developmental genetics underlying suction feeding in modern amphibians to better understand the evolutionary pathways that might lead to such specialized adaptations.
