# **Adapting Fluency Therapy for Children with Co-occurring Apraxia and Anxiety**

## **1\. Introduction**

The simultaneous presence of fluency disorders, specifically stuttering, and childhood apraxia of speech (CAS) in children aged 8-12 presents a complex clinical picture 1. While stuttering is characterized by disruptions in the flow of speech, such as repetitions, prolongations, and blocks, CAS is a motor speech disorder involving difficulties in planning and coordinating the movements necessary for producing speech sounds 2. This co-occurrence creates unique challenges for these children, impacting not only their ability to produce fluent and intelligible speech but also their emotional well-being 2. The motor planning deficits inherent in CAS can manifest as stuttering-like behaviors, and the anxiety often associated with stuttering can further complicate the motor coordination required for clear articulation 4. Therefore, interventions must address both the motor speech difficulties and the potential for anxiety related to communication.

The "Easy Does It" approach is a well-established method in fluency therapy, focusing on techniques that promote forward-flowing speech and ease in initiating words 5. This approach emphasizes the active role of the individual in identifying and modifying stuttering patterns, encouraging self-monitoring and self-reinforcement 5. Integrating mindfulness-based strategies offers a complementary approach to manage the anxiety that frequently accompanies stuttering and to enhance the child's self-awareness of their speech patterns and any related physical tension 12. By cultivating present moment awareness and non-judgmental observation, children can learn to better understand and regulate their emotional responses to speaking situations 12. This report aims to provide a framework for speech-language pathologists (SLPs) to adapt the "Easy Does It" approach by incorporating mindfulness techniques within a group treatment setting for children aged 8-12 who exhibit both stuttering and apraxia of speech. This integrated approach seeks to address the multifaceted needs of this population, fostering improvements in speech fluency, articulation accuracy, and overall communication confidence.

The co-occurrence of stuttering and CAS necessitates a therapy approach that is adaptable and considers the distinct characteristics of each condition while acknowledging their potential interaction. Stuttering primarily affects the rhythm and flow of speech, whereas apraxia impacts the production of speech sounds due to motor planning deficits. When these conditions coexist, the child might exhibit disfluencies stemming from the effort required for motor planning, or anxiety related to stuttering could further disrupt their motor coordination. Therefore, a combined therapeutic strategy should target both the fluency aspects of stuttering and the underlying motor planning difficulties of apraxia. Furthermore, mindfulness can be a valuable supplementary tool by directly addressing the anxiety often associated with stuttering and potentially improving focus and self-awareness, which can benefit both fluency and motor speech control. Anxiety is a known factor that can worsen stuttering. Mindfulness techniques have been shown to reduce anxiety. By integrating mindfulness for children who stutter and have apraxia, it is possible to see improvements in their overall speech production as they may experience less pressure and tension during speaking. Additionally, increased self-awareness cultivated through mindfulness can aid them in identifying and modifying their speech patterns more effectively.

## **2\. The "Easy Does It" Approach to Fluency Therapy**

The "Easy Does It" approach to fluency therapy is a direct intervention strategy designed to help individuals who stutter develop smoother, more confident speech 8. The core principles revolve around promoting forward-flowing speech and utilizing word-initiation techniques, tailored to the specific needs of the student 5. A key aspect of this approach is the active involvement of the student in their therapy process. They are encouraged to identify their own stuttering behaviors and to actively participate in determining what changes need to occur 10. This fosters a sense of ownership and commitment to the therapeutic process 8. The program emphasizes the importance of students verbalizing their goals and the behaviors they are working to modify. Furthermore, self-monitoring and self-reinforcement are integral components, empowering students to take an active role in their progress 5. The "Easy Does It" approach recognizes that fluency development involves changes across motor, linguistic, and psychosocial domains, and learning is facilitated through modeling 7.

Key techniques within the "Easy Does It" framework include:

* **Easy Onsets**: This technique focuses on initiating speech with a gentle and relaxed start, rather than a forceful or abrupt beginning 15. It involves a soft initiation of vocal fold vibration and airflow at the beginning of words or phrases 15. For example, when starting a word beginning with a vowel, the individual might precede it with a gentle /h/ sound, such as saying "hhhh-apple" instead of a hard onset 16. This gradual onset helps to reduce tension in the vocal folds and promotes a smoother initiation of speech 16.  
* **Light Contacts**: This technique involves using gentle and minimal physical contact between the articulators (lips, tongue, teeth, jaw) when producing sounds and words 20. The goal is to reduce muscle tension in the speech mechanism, which can often contribute to stuttering 24. For instance, when producing bilabial sounds like /p/, /b/, or /m/, the individual is encouraged to bring their lips together with very little force, almost like a feather touch 22.  
* **Bouncing**: This stuttering modification technique involves producing sounds or words in an easier manner, often through a light and controlled repetition of the initial sound or syllable of a word 26. For example, instead of saying "b-b-ball" with tension, the individual might gently bounce the initial sound, saying "ba-ba-ball" with reduced effort 27. This technique can help to increase awareness of tension in speech and promote a more comfortable approach to moments of stuttering 26.  
* **Sliding (Pull-outs)**: This technique is employed during an actual moment of stuttering 26. It involves recognizing the moment of disfluency and then gently stretching or easing out of the stuttered sound or word with reduced tension, allowing speech to continue flowing 26. The individual identifies the tension in their articulators and consciously works to reduce that tension while completing the word 31.

The "Easy Does It" program for children in the 6-12 age range (Intermediate level) is structured around six levels of progression 8:

1. **Getting Ready**: The student learns about the therapy process and expectations and decides whether to commit to it.  
2. **Analyzing**: The student differentiates between easy disfluencies and stuttering in their own speech.  
3. **Modifying Speech Production**: The student produces easy speech using techniques like bouncing, sliding, light contacts, and easy onsets.  
4. **Desensitizing**: Fluency disruptors are introduced, and the student learns to tolerate them while continuing to use easy speech.  
5. **Transferring**: The student gradually moves from using easy speech in the therapy room to spontaneous speech in real-life situations, with increasing complexity and length of responses.  
6. **Maintaining**: Therapy is gradually phased out as the student maintains fluent speech.

The program specifically addresses three potential components of stuttering: motor (rate control, continuous phonation, and the use of techniques), linguistic (language skills for various communication purposes), and psychosocial (attitudes, emotional reactions, and desensitization to disruptors) 8. The emphasis throughout the "Easy Does It" approach is on empowering students to take an active role in their therapy by encouraging them to verbalize their goals, monitor their speech, and reinforce their progress 5.

| Technique | Definition | Primary Focus | Relevance to Stuttering |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Easy Onsets | Initiating speech with a gentle and relaxed start, using soft vocal fold vibration and airflow. | Motor | Reduces tension at the beginning of words, promoting smoother initiation. |
| Light Contacts | Using minimal physical contact between articulators during speech production. | Motor | Decreases muscle tension throughout speech, facilitating a more relaxed flow. |
| Bouncing | Producing sounds or words in an easier manner, often through gentle repetition of initial sounds or syllables with reduced tension. | Motor | Increases awareness of tension and promotes a more comfortable approach to stuttering moments. |
| Sliding (Pull-outs) | Recognizing and gently easing out of a moment of stuttering with reduced tension, allowing speech to continue. | Motor | Provides a strategy to manage stuttering in real-time by reducing tension and maintaining forward flow. |

The "Easy Does It" approach offers a structured and comprehensive framework for addressing stuttering in school-aged children. Its focus on motor, linguistic, and psychosocial aspects acknowledges the multifaceted nature of fluency disorders. The program's emphasis on active student participation and self-monitoring aligns well with the goal of increasing self-awareness, a crucial component in both fluency therapy and mindfulness practices. The techniques taught within this framework, such as easy onsets and light contacts, aim to reduce physical tension and promote smoother speech initiation and production. This aligns with the need to address potential tension that can exacerbate both stuttering and the motor planning challenges associated with apraxia. Furthermore, the program's progression through various levels, from analysis to transfer and maintenance, provides a systematic approach to therapy, ensuring that skills are not only learned but also generalized to real-life situations. The active role of the student in setting goals and monitoring their progress fosters a sense of ownership and can enhance motivation, which is particularly important when addressing complex, co-occurring conditions.

## **3\. Understanding Childhood Apraxia of Speech**

Childhood apraxia of speech (CAS) is characterized by a fundamental difficulty in planning and coordinating the complex sequences of muscle movements required for producing speech 2. This motor speech disorder is present from birth, and it is not due to muscle weakness or paralysis 2. Children with CAS know what they want to say, but their brains struggle to direct the speech muscles (lips, jaw, tongue) to create the necessary movements in the correct order and timing 2. A hallmark of CAS is inconsistent errors in producing consonants and vowels, even when repeating the same word 2. Other common characteristics include difficulty putting sounds and syllables together in the correct sequence, resulting in long pauses between sounds or syllables 2. Prosody, the rhythm and intonation of speech that conveys meaning, is also often affected, with speech potentially sounding monotone or having incorrect stress patterns 2.

Common articulation errors observed in children with CAS include substituting one sound for another (e.g., saying "wabbit" for "rabbit"), omitting sounds, particularly final consonants (e.g., saying "duh" for "duck"), stopping the airflow for sounds that should be continuous (e.g., saying "tun" for "sun"), and simplifying complex sound combinations (e.g., saying "ting" for "string") 1. Children with CAS often experience challenges with prosody, which can manifest as speaking in a monotone voice, placing stress on the wrong syllable of a word (e.g., "buh-NAN-uh" instead of "ba-NAN-uh"), or using equal emphasis on all syllables 2. This can make their speech sound unnatural or robotic 36.

It is crucial to differentiate between CAS and stuttering. CAS is a disorder of motor coordination for speech production, whereas stuttering is a fluency disorder characterized by disruptions in the flow and timing of speech 1. While a child with CAS might say a word incorrectly due to a motor planning breakdown, a child who stutters typically knows how to produce the sounds in a word but experiences involuntary repetitions, prolongations, or blocks 1. However, it is important to note that in acquired apraxia, fluency symptoms such as sound and syllable repetitions and difficulty initiating speech can be observed 38. This highlights the potential for overlap in surface-level symptoms, underscoring the need for careful and comprehensive assessment to accurately diagnose co-occurring conditions.

| Feature | Childhood Apraxia of Speech | Stuttering |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Primary Disorder Type | Motor Speech Disorder | Fluency Disorder |
| Core Difficulty | Planning and coordinating speech movements | Rhythm and flow of speech |
| Nature of Errors | Inconsistent articulation errors (substitutions, omissions, distortions), prosodic errors | Disfluencies (repetitions, prolongations, blocks) |
| Consistency of Errors | Errors vary even when repeating the same word | Disfluencies are often unpredictable and vary in type and severity |
| Awareness of Errors | May or may not be fully aware, especially initially | Typically aware and may exhibit tension or secondary behaviors |
| Presence of Secondary Behaviors | Groping movements of articulators may be present | Secondary behaviors related to tension and avoidance are common |

The motor planning and sequencing deficits in CAS are fundamentally distinct from the disfluencies observed in stuttering. While both conditions can disrupt the smooth flow of speech, CAS involves errors in the actual production of sounds due to the brain's difficulty in directing the speech muscles. Stuttering, on the other hand, involves interruptions in the rhythm and timing of speech despite the individual's ability to produce the necessary sounds. This fundamental difference necessitates tailored therapeutic approaches that address the specific challenges posed by each disorder. For instance, therapy for CAS often focuses on repetitive practice of target sounds and sound sequences with various cues to facilitate motor learning, whereas stuttering therapy may involve techniques to manage disfluencies and reduce tension. Recognizing this distinction is paramount for developing effective interventions when both conditions are present.

## **4\. Challenges of Co-occurring Stuttering and Apraxia**

Diagnosing the co-occurrence of stuttering and apraxia in children presents significant complexities 1. The overlapping nature of some symptoms can make it challenging to differentiate between the two disorders and to determine the primary and secondary conditions. For instance, the sound and syllable repetitions that can occur in both stuttering and apraxia can make it difficult to pinpoint the underlying cause of these disfluencies 4. Accurate diagnosis requires careful observation and comprehensive testing by an experienced SLP who can analyze the specific characteristics of the child's speech patterns 1.

The motor planning difficulties inherent in apraxia can indeed manifest as behaviors that resemble stuttering 4. A child with CAS might produce sound or syllable repetitions as they attempt to find the correct motor plan for a word. Hesitations and pauses can also occur as the child struggles to sequence the necessary articulatory movements 4. This can lead to a presentation that might initially be mistaken for stuttering, highlighting the importance of a thorough assessment that looks beyond surface-level disfluencies to identify underlying motor planning deficits.

Anxiety and frustration, often associated with stuttering, can further complicate the motor coordination challenges faced by children with apraxia 3. When a child who stutters also has apraxia, their anxiety about experiencing disfluencies might lead to increased tension in their speech muscles. This tension can then negatively impact their ability to execute the precise motor movements required for accurate articulation in apraxia, potentially creating a negative feedback loop where anxiety exacerbates both conditions 4.

Furthermore, children with apraxia are at a higher risk for word retrieval difficulties 4. The process of searching for the right word can lead to hesitations, pauses, and even repetitions as the child attempts to maintain their turn in a conversation while struggling to access the desired vocabulary. These word retrieval challenges can further complicate the child's speech fluency, adding another layer to the complexity of co-occurring stuttering and apraxia.

The presence of both stuttering and apraxia can significantly impact a child's overall communication effectiveness, their social interactions, and their emotional well-being 3. Difficulties in producing clear and fluent speech can lead to frustration and reduced confidence in communication attempts 36. This can affect their ability to express their needs and wants effectively, potentially impacting their social interactions with peers and adults 3. The psychological and emotional consequences of stuttering, such as social anxiety and negative self-perceptions, can be compounded by the challenges of apraxia, leading to a significant impact on the child's overall quality of life 3.

The overlap in symptoms between apraxia and stuttering, such as sound repetitions and hesitations, makes accurate differential diagnosis a considerable challenge. It is essential to meticulously analyze the specific characteristics of the disfluencies and articulation errors to accurately identify both the primary and co-occurring conditions. Therapy must then be tailored to address both the motor planning deficits and the fluency breaks, taking into account how each condition might influence the other. For example, if a child exhibits sound repetitions, it is crucial to determine whether these are primarily due to motor planning breakdowns in apraxia or moments of stuttering. The intervention strategies will differ depending on the underlying cause. Furthermore, the presence of anxiety can obscure the clinical picture, as it can exacerbate both stuttering and motor speech difficulties.

The frustration and anxiety that often accompany both stuttering and apraxia can create a detrimental cycle. Speech difficulties can lead to increased anxiety, which in turn can worsen speech production. Integrating strategies to manage anxiety, such as mindfulness, becomes particularly important in breaking this cycle and fostering a more positive and effective communication experience for the child. By teaching children to observe their anxiety without judgment and to utilize relaxation techniques, it is possible to reduce overall tension and potentially improve both fluency and articulation.

## **5\. Mindfulness-Based Strategies in Pediatric Speech Therapy**

Mindfulness is a practice that involves paying attention to the present moment with intention and without judgment 12. It is about being fully engaged in what is happening right now, rather than dwelling on the past or worrying about the future 14. This non-judgmental observation of one's thoughts, feelings, and bodily sensations is a core principle of mindfulness 12.

For children with speech disorders, particularly those experiencing anxiety related to their communication difficulties, mindfulness-based strategies can offer significant benefits 12. By learning to focus on the present moment, children can reduce the impact of anticipatory anxiety about speaking situations or specific sounds 12. Mindfulness can also enhance self-awareness, helping children to become more attuned to the physical sensations associated with speech tension and to recognize their thought patterns surrounding speaking 14. This increased awareness can empower them to manage their anxiety more effectively and to make conscious efforts to modify their speech patterns.

Several mindfulness techniques are particularly suitable for children aged 8-12:

* **Breathing Exercises**: These exercises focus on bringing awareness to the breath, which can help to calm the mind and body 14. Examples include belly breathing (noticing the rise and fall of the abdomen with each breath), flower and bubbles (imagining smelling a flower and gently blowing bubbles), and bunny breathing (taking short, quick sniffs followed by a long exhale) 42.  
* **Body Scan Meditations**: These involve bringing focused attention to different parts of the body, noticing any sensations without judgment 12. This can help children become more aware of areas where they might hold tension, such as their jaw, neck, or shoulders, which can be relevant to speech production.  
* **Sensory Awareness Activities**: These activities encourage children to engage their five senses to become more present in their environment 12. Examples include the 5 senses game (identifying things they can see, hear, feel, smell, and taste), mindful eating (paying close attention to the taste, texture, and smell of food), and exploring sounds (listening attentively to the sounds around them) 12.  
* **Guided Imagery and Visualization**: These techniques involve using descriptive language to guide children to imagine peaceful and calming scenes 45. This can help to shift their focus away from anxieties and promote relaxation.  
* **Mindful Movement**: Activities like simple yoga stretches or mindful posing can help children connect with their bodies and release tension 12. Focusing on the physical sensations during movement can bring them into the present moment.  
* **Mindful Listening Activities**: Using tools like a mindfulness bell, children can focus their attention on the sound as it fades away, helping to cultivate concentration and present moment awareness 43.

These mindfulness techniques can help children become more aware of the physical sensations in their mouth and throat that might indicate speech tension 12. By paying attention to these sensations without judgment, they can learn to identify when they are becoming tense and potentially take steps to relax. Furthermore, mindfulness can help children observe their thought patterns around speaking. They might notice negative thoughts or fears arising before or during speaking situations. By practicing non-judgmental awareness, they can learn to recognize these thoughts without getting carried away by them, creating a space to respond more calmly and effectively 14.

Mindfulness offers a valuable set of tools to address the emotional and attentional challenges faced by children with co-occurring stuttering and apraxia. By teaching them to focus on the present moment and observe their experiences without judgment, we can help them manage anxiety related to speaking and develop a greater awareness of their speech patterns, including moments of tension or disfluency. The variety of mindfulness techniques available allows for tailoring interventions to the individual needs and preferences of children in a group setting. Some children might respond better to movement-based mindfulness, while others might find more benefit in quiet breathing exercises or sensory activities. This flexibility is essential in a group setting with diverse needs.

## **6\. Adapting "Easy Does It" for Children with Apraxia**

The core principles of the "Easy Does It" approach, with its emphasis on forward-flowing speech and the use of word initiation techniques, can serve as a strong foundation for addressing both the fluency challenges of stuttering and the motor speech difficulties associated with apraxia 8. The focus on achieving a continuous flow of speech aligns well with the broader goal of improving overall speech production in children with apraxia. Additionally, the specific word initiation techniques taught in "Easy Does It," such as easy onsets and light contacts, can be beneficial not only for reducing stuttering but also for addressing the difficulties in initiating sounds that are often observed in apraxia 15.

To effectively accommodate the motor planning and sequencing difficulties inherent in apraxia, specific modifications to the "Easy Does It" techniques can be implemented:

* **Easy Onsets**: When working with children who have apraxia, the focus on gently initiating airflow and voice should be coupled with explicit attention to correct articulatory placement for the initial sound 15. Incorporating visual cues, such as using a mirror to show the child the correct mouth shape, or tactile cues, such as gently touching the child's lips or tongue to guide their positioning, can provide crucial support for motor learning 38. For instance, if a child with apraxia is struggling to initiate the /b/ sound, the therapist might pair the easy onset technique with a visual demonstration of the lips coming together gently and a tactile cue of lightly tapping the child's lips.  
* **Light Contacts**: The technique of using minimal articulatory contact should be emphasized with a focus on achieving the precise placement needed for each sound 20. Visual feedback, such as having the child use a mirror to observe their articulators, can help them ensure appropriate placement and avoid using unnecessary tension that could impede the motor planning required for accurate sound production 23. For example, when practicing words containing the sounds /t/ and /d/, the therapist can use a mirror to show the child the light touch of the tongue tip to the alveolar ridge, contrasting this with a harder, more forceful contact that might be typical for someone with apraxia.  
* **Bouncing**: While "bouncing" in traditional fluency therapy often focuses on the fluency aspect of repeating initial sounds or syllables with reduced tension 26, when adapted for apraxia, this technique can be modified to involve gentle, controlled repetitions of syllables or short words with a primary emphasis on accurate articulation during each repetition 27. This provides additional practice for the motor sequencing involved in producing the target sounds. For instance, when working on the word "baby," the therapist might adapt bouncing to "ba-ba-baby," ensuring that the child focuses on the correct production of each syllable with clear articulation, rather than solely on the repetition itself.  
* **Sliding (Pull-outs)**: The traditional "sliding" or "pull-out" technique in fluency therapy is used during a moment of stuttering to ease out of the disfluency with reduced tension 26. When adapting this for apraxia, the focus can be broadened to include consciously adjusting articulatory placement and reducing tension during any moment of articulatory difficulty, not just a moment of stuttering 34. This helps the child regain motor control over their articulators. For example, if a child with apraxia starts to struggle with the /s/ sound in the word "sun," the therapist might guide them to gently stretch the sound while consciously checking their tongue placement (e.g., "ssssun"), with the primary focus on the articulatory movement rather than just the flow of speech.

Given the motor learning challenges in apraxia, it is crucial to incorporate visual, tactile, and proprioceptive cues to support the child's learning of correct speech movements 38. These sensory inputs can provide additional feedback and guidance to facilitate accurate articulation. Additionally, adopting a slightly slower rate of speech during therapy activities can serve as a general modification to aid motor planning for children with apraxia 22. Modeling a somewhat slower rate can give the child more time to plan and execute the complex sequences of movements required for speech production, which can also have a positive impact on fluency.

Adapting "Easy Does It" for apraxia involves shifting the therapeutic focus from solely addressing fluency to also prioritizing accurate articulation and motor planning. The techniques need to be modified to incorporate strategies that support motor learning, such as providing ample sensory cues and focusing on the quality of articulatory movements during each technique. While the core techniques of "Easy Does It" like easy onsets and light contacts are relevant for reducing tension and promoting smoother speech, they might not directly address the underlying motor planning issues in apraxia. By adding visual (e.g., mouth models, mirrors), tactile (e.g., touching articulators), and proprioceptive (e.g., awareness of muscle movements) cues, we can provide the extra support needed for these children to learn and execute the correct speech movements. The goal is to use the "Easy Does It" framework as a vehicle for practicing accurate articulation with reduced tension. Furthermore, the concept of "easy speech" in "Easy Does It" can be expanded to include "accurate speech" for children with apraxia. The focus should be on producing sounds and syllables correctly with reduced effort, which can then contribute to improved fluency. For a child with apraxia, a moment of disfluency might be directly related to their struggle to produce a specific sound or sequence of sounds accurately. By focusing on achieving accurate production through adapted "Easy Does It" techniques and sensory supports, we can potentially reduce the frequency of these articulatory breakdowns, which might in turn lead to smoother overall speech.

## **7\. Integrating Mindfulness into the Adapted "Easy Does It" Approach**

Integrating mindfulness practices into the adapted "Easy Does It" approach can provide a powerful way to address the anxiety and enhance self-awareness in children with co-occurring stuttering and apraxia. Mindfulness exercises can be strategically woven into various stages and activities of the therapy program to support both speech production and emotional regulation 12.

At the beginning of each therapy session, incorporating a brief mindfulness exercise, such as 1-2 minutes of mindful breathing or a short body scan, can help children ground themselves, reduce any initial anxiety, and improve their focus before engaging in speech activities 12. During speech practice, encourage children to bring mindful awareness to the physical sensations in their mouth and throat as they practice the adapted "Easy Does It" techniques. Prompt them to notice any tension they might be holding in their articulators and to consciously try to release that tension 12.

When addressing fluency disruptors in the desensitizing stage of the "Easy Does It" program, mindfulness techniques can be invaluable. Help children observe their reactions, such as feelings of anxiety or physical tension, to these disruptors without judgment 12. Encourage them to practice using their adapted "Easy Does It" techniques while maintaining a present and calm awareness of their thoughts and feelings 12. Before engaging in transfer tasks, where children practice using their skills in real-life situations, a quick mindfulness exercise can help them feel more centered and less anxious about speaking outside the familiar therapy room 13. Remind them to bring a mindful awareness to their speech in these novel contexts. Finally, concluding each therapy session with a brief gratitude exercise or another calming mindfulness activity can promote a positive association with therapy and encourage self-reflection on their experiences 44.

Specific mindfulness techniques can be effectively paired with the adapted "Easy Does It" activities:

* **Easy Onsets with Mindful Breathing**: Before initiating a word using an easy onset, guide the child to take a slow, deep breath and to mindfully notice the sensation of the air entering and leaving their body. Encourage them to maintain this relaxed breath as they gently start the word 14.  
* **Light Contacts with Body Awareness**: While practicing light articulatory contacts, direct the child's attention to the specific parts of their mouth involved in producing the sound. Encourage them to mindfully notice the feeling of light touch between their articulators, consciously avoiding any unnecessary tension 12.  
* **Bouncing with Mindful Observation**: During the controlled repetition of a sound or syllable in the bouncing technique, encourage the child to pay close attention to how their articulators feel and sound in that precise moment, without any self-judgment 12.  
* **Sliding with Emotional Awareness**: When a child experiences a moment of articulatory difficulty and uses a pull-out, prompt them to mindfully notice any emotions that might arise, such as frustration or embarrassment. Encourage them to gently guide themselves out of the difficulty with a calm and focused awareness of both their articulatory movements and their emotional state 12.

It is crucial for the therapist to model mindfulness practices themselves, as this can significantly enhance the children's engagement and understanding of these techniques 43. The therapist's own calm and present demeanor can create a more conducive environment for mindfulness practice. Additionally, using visual aids, such as glitter jars to represent swirling thoughts or breathing balls to demonstrate the rhythm of breath, can make the abstract concepts of mindfulness more concrete and accessible for children 12.

| Adapted "Easy Does It" Technique | Mindfulness Technique Integration | Potential Benefit |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Easy Onsets | Mindful Breathing | Promotes relaxation and gentle initiation of speech sounds. |
| Light Contacts | Body Awareness | Increases focus on articulatory movements and reduces unnecessary tension. |
| Bouncing | Mindful Observation | Enhances awareness of articulatory sensations during controlled repetitions. |
| Sliding | Emotional Awareness | Helps manage emotional reactions during moments of speech difficulty and promotes calm self-correction. |

Integrating mindfulness into "Easy Does It" is not about adding more tasks to the therapy session but rather about enhancing the child's awareness and emotional regulation during the existing activities. By intentionally focusing on the present moment and their internal experience, children can develop a deeper understanding of their speech patterns and their reactions to them. This approach transforms the speech techniques from mere exercises into opportunities for self-discovery and emotional growth. The combination of targeted speech techniques from "Easy Does It" and the anxiety-reducing effects of mindfulness can create a powerful synergistic effect, leading to more significant and sustainable improvements in both fluency and speech production for children with co-occurring disorders. By addressing both the motor and emotional components of their speech difficulties, this integrated approach tackles the challenges from multiple angles, fostering a path towards more confident and effective communication.

## **8\. Group Therapy Considerations for Diverse Needs**

Conducting group speech therapy for children aged 8-12 with mixed profiles of fluency disorders and apraxia presents both unique benefits and specific challenges. A significant advantage of group therapy is the opportunity for peer interaction and support 49. Children can learn from each other's experiences, practice their communication skills in a more naturalistic setting, and build a sense of community 49. However, the diverse needs of children with varying levels of severity in both stuttering and apraxia can pose challenges in terms of individualizing treatment goals and ensuring that all participants are actively engaged and making progress 50.

Strategies for individualizing treatment goals within a group setting are essential 10. While the overall theme of the group sessions might focus on the adapted "Easy Does It" approach and mindfulness, activities should be structured to allow for individual practice of specific techniques or articulation targets. For instance, during a group reading activity, each child can focus on implementing their particular "Easy Does It" technique or on accurately producing their target speech sounds. The therapist can provide individualized feedback and support during these activities. Utilizing a station-based approach can also be effective, where different stations target various aspects of speech production or mindfulness, allowing children to rotate through activities that are most relevant to their individual goals 50.

Adapting both the "Easy Does It" techniques and mindfulness activities for a group requires careful planning. For "Easy Does It," group activities such as shared reading, storytelling, or structured conversation practice can provide opportunities for children to implement their techniques in a supportive environment 51. The therapist can model the techniques and provide guidance and feedback to the group as a whole and to individual members. For mindfulness, lead group exercises that are accessible to all participants, such as guided breathing, body scans, or mindful listening activities 12. The length and complexity of these exercises should be adapted based on the children's attention spans and individual needs.

Creating a supportive and accepting group environment is paramount for reducing anxiety and fostering self-confidence 8. Establish clear group norms that emphasize respect, encouragement, and non-judgmental communication. Incorporate activities that promote empathy and understanding among group members, helping them to feel safe and supported in their communication efforts.

Managing different levels of severity and engagement within the group requires flexibility 50. Offer differentiated activities or roles within activities to ensure that all children are challenged and engaged at their appropriate level. For children who may need additional support or who finish tasks early, provide alternative activities or fidget toys to help them stay focused 50. Clear visual supports and instructions can also aid in maintaining engagement and understanding.

Peer modeling and positive reinforcement play a significant role in a group setting 6. Encourage children to provide positive feedback to each other (with guidance from the therapist) on their speech attempts and their use of mindfulness techniques. Celebrate each other's efforts and progress, fostering a sense of collective achievement and mutual support.

Group therapy can be a valuable modality for children with co-occurring stuttering and apraxia, offering opportunities for social interaction, peer support, and generalization of skills in a less clinical setting. However, it requires careful planning and flexibility to address the diverse needs of the group members and ensure that each child benefits from the interventions. The social aspect of group therapy can be particularly beneficial for children who may feel isolated due to their speech difficulties. Interacting with peers who have similar challenges can reduce feelings of being alone and provide valuable opportunities to practice communication skills in a more natural context. However, the therapist must be skilled in managing a group with varying needs, ensuring that each child receives adequate individual attention and that the activities are adapted to their specific goals. Integrating mindfulness into group therapy can help create a more calm and focused environment, reducing overall anxiety and promoting a sense of shared experience among the children. This can enhance their engagement with both the "Easy Does It" techniques and the therapy process as a whole. Starting group sessions with a brief mindfulness exercise can set a positive tone and help children transition into therapy mode. Throughout the session, incorporating mindful moments can help them stay present and focused on their speech goals, while also fostering a sense of connection and shared experience with their peers. This can be particularly helpful in reducing the anxiety that some children might feel about speaking in front of others.

## **9\. Practical Implementation and Activity Ideas**

Implementing the adapted "Easy Does It" approach with mindfulness in a group setting can be achieved through a variety of engaging and age-appropriate activities:

* **Mindful Storytelling**: Select a story that is of interest to the children. Have them take turns reading sentences or short paragraphs aloud. Before each turn, lead a brief mindful breathing exercise. Encourage the child who is reading to focus on using their adapted "Easy Does It" techniques, such as easy onsets and light contacts, while being mindful of their breath and any tension they might feel in their speech muscles. After each child reads, invite them to share how they felt while speaking, fostering self-awareness and open communication.  
* **"Speech Sound Safari" with Sensory Awareness**: Create a game where children go on a "safari" to find pictures or objects hidden around the room that contain their individual target speech sounds. As they find an item, they must name it using their adapted "Easy Does It" techniques. To integrate sensory awareness, ask them to describe the texture, color, or smell of the object, encouraging them to bring their attention to the present moment and engage multiple senses.  
* **Mindful Conversation Practice**: Choose age-appropriate conversation topics that encourage interaction among the children. Before starting the conversation, guide the group through a short body scan exercise to help them become aware of any tension they might be holding in their bodies. During the conversation, gently remind them to use their "Easy Does It" techniques and to be mindful of both their speaking and listening. Encourage active listening by having them summarize what their peers have said.  
* **"Easy Does It" Board Game with Mindfulness Prompts**: Adapt a simple board game that the children enjoy by adding prompts to certain spaces. These prompts can encourage them to practice their specific "Easy Does It" techniques (e.g., "Say your next word with a light onset") or to engage in a brief mindfulness exercise (e.g., "Take three mindful breaths and notice how your body feels"). This gamified approach can make practicing the techniques more engaging and fun.  
* **Role-Playing with Emotional Regulation**: Have the children role-play common social scenarios that might evoke anxiety related to speaking, such as ordering food at a restaurant or asking for help at school. Before the role-play begins, practice a calming mindfulness technique, such as a guided breathing exercise. During the role-play, encourage them to use their adapted "Easy Does It" techniques and to be mindful of any emotions that arise, practicing strategies for emotional regulation.

To enhance engagement, incorporate play-based learning into the therapy sessions 6. Use puppets, toys, and games to make the activities more interactive and motivating. Allow the children to have some choice in the activities and materials used, fostering a sense of ownership and interest.

Utilizing visual supports and timers can provide structure to the activities and promote self-monitoring 8. Use visual schedules to clearly show the flow of the session and the sequence of activities. Employ timers to help keep activities focused and to teach children about managing their time. Visual cues, such as pictures or simple drawings representing easy onset, light contact, or mindful breathing, can serve as helpful reminders during activities.

The success of implementation relies on making the adapted "Easy Does It" techniques and mindfulness strategies feel natural and integrated into the therapy activities. The activities should be designed to be engaging and appropriate for the children's age and developmental levels, fostering a positive and supportive learning environment where they feel comfortable taking risks and practicing their communication skills. Children in this age group often learn best through active participation and play. By embedding the therapeutic techniques within fun and engaging activities, we can increase their motivation and make the learning process more enjoyable, which can lead to greater carryover of skills and a more positive attitude towards therapy. Furthermore, providing structure and visual supports can be particularly beneficial for children with apraxia, who may thrive on clear routines and visual reminders. Timers can also help to keep activities focused and provide a sense of predictability, which can be calming for children who experience anxiety around speaking.

## **10\. Conclusion**

Adapting the "Easy Does It" approach to fluency therapy for children aged 8-12 with co-occurring stuttering and apraxia, while integrating mindfulness-based strategies, requires careful consideration of the unique challenges presented by this complex combination of disorders. Accurate assessment and differential diagnosis are crucial to understanding the primary and co-occurring conditions. The core techniques of "Easy Does It" can be modified to specifically address the motor planning deficits inherent in apraxia by incorporating visual, tactile, and proprioceptive cues and emphasizing accurate articulation alongside fluency. Integrating mindfulness provides a valuable tool for managing the anxiety that often accompanies stuttering and for enhancing the child's self-awareness of their speech patterns and any related physical tension. Effective group therapy management necessitates strategies for individualizing treatment goals, adapting activities for diverse needs, creating a supportive environment, and leveraging peer modeling and reinforcement.

This integrated approach holds significant potential for improving not only speech fluency and articulation accuracy but also the overall communication confidence and emotional well-being of these children. By addressing both the motor and emotional aspects of their communication difficulties, therapy can become more holistic and effective. It is essential to emphasize the importance of individualized assessment and the need for a flexible implementation of these strategies, with ongoing monitoring of each child's progress to ensure that their specific needs are being met. With a tailored and compassionate therapeutic approach that combines structured speech techniques with mindful awareness, children with co-occurring stuttering and apraxia can make significant gains in their communication abilities, leading to greater confidence and participation in their daily lives. Continued professional development and collaboration among SLPs working with this population will further refine best practices and contribute to improved outcomes for these children.
