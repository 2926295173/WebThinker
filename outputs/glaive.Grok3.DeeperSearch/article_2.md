### Implications of Variable Ratio vs. Fixed Ratio Schedules

#### Overview  
In token economy systems, individuals with developmental disabilities earn tokens for desired behaviors, which can be exchanged for rewards. The schedule of reinforcement—whether variable ratio (VR) or fixed ratio (FR)—affects how these behaviors are encouraged and maintained. VR provides reinforcement after an unpredictable number of responses, while FR does so after a set number, impacting adaptive behavior (desired actions) and problem behavior (undesired actions).

#### Promoting Adaptive Behavior  
- VR schedules seem likely to promote consistent adaptive behavior by maintaining steady engagement, as the unpredictability keeps individuals motivated without long pauses.  
- FR schedules may lead to bursts of activity followed by pauses, potentially reducing overall adaptive behavior during these breaks.  
- For example, a study on deaf children found VR led to higher math performance and attention, suggesting better adaptive behavior ([A comparison of the effects of fixed and variable ratio schedules of reinforcement on the behavior of deaf children](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1308102/)).

#### Reducing Problem Behavior  
- The evidence leans toward VR reducing problem behavior by minimizing pauses, leaving less time for undesired actions to occur. A study with deaf children showed less disruptive behavior under VR compared to FR, supporting this idea.  
- FR schedules might increase problem behavior during post-reinforcement pauses, as seen in some autism studies where sessions were stopped early due to behavior issues, possibly linked to FR conditions.  
- However, individual differences mean outcomes can vary, and more research is needed for a definitive conclusion.

#### Unexpected Detail: Individual Variability  
While VR generally shows benefits, some studies, like one with children with autism, found mixed results, with one participant showing higher adaptive behavior under FR but potentially more problem behavior, highlighting the need for tailored approaches based on the individual.

### Survey Note: Detailed Analysis of Reinforcement Schedules in Token Economies

This section provides a comprehensive examination of the implications of using variable ratio (VR) versus fixed ratio (FR) schedules of reinforcement within token economy systems for individuals with developmental disabilities, focusing on promoting adaptive behavior and reducing problem behavior. The analysis draws on research findings and theoretical principles, ensuring a thorough understanding for practitioners and researchers.

#### Background on Token Economies and Reinforcement Schedules  
Token economies are behavioral interventions where individuals earn tokens for displaying desired behaviors, which can later be exchanged for rewards. They are widely used for individuals with developmental disabilities, such as autism and intellectual disabilities, to encourage positive behaviors and reduce negative ones. Reinforcement schedules dictate when tokens are earned or exchanged, with VR and FR being two common types. VR involves reinforcement after an unpredictable number of responses, while FR does so after a fixed number, each influencing behavior differently.

#### Theoretical Implications  
From behavioral psychology, VR schedules are known to produce high and steady rates of responding due to their unpredictability, similar to gambling, where individuals continue behaviors without knowing when the next reward will come. This steady engagement can reduce opportunities for problem behaviors, as there are fewer pauses. Conversely, FR schedules often result in a post-reinforcement pause after the fixed number of responses is met, during which problem behaviors might emerge, such as disruptive actions or non-compliance.

In token economies, these schedules can apply to token production (earning tokens) or token exchange (exchanging tokens for rewards). The overall effect is often a second-order schedule, where the exchange schedule significantly influences behavior patterns. For instance, a VR exchange schedule might maintain consistent responding, while an FR exchange schedule could lead to pauses after exchanges, potentially increasing problem behavior.

#### Research Findings on Adaptive Behavior  
Research suggests VR schedules may be more effective in promoting adaptive behavior, defined as desired actions like completing tasks or attending to activities. A study on deaf children, "A comparison of the effects of fixed and variable ratio schedules of reinforcement on the behavior of deaf children" ([A comparison of the effects of fixed and variable ratio schedules of reinforcement on the behavior of deaf children](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1308102/)), found that under VR, students exhibited higher visual attention and completed more math problems per minute compared to FR, indicating better adaptive behavior. This aligns with the theory that VR maintains steady engagement.

However, a study on children with autism, "A Comparison of Variable Ratio and Fixed Ratio Schedules of Token Reinforcement" ([A Comparison of Variable Ratio and Fixed Ratio Schedules of Token Reinforcement](https://repository.library.northeastern.edu/files/neu:519/fulltext.pdf)), showed mixed results. For one participant, Elizabeth, FR led to higher response rates (~115 responses/min) compared to VR (~85 responses/min), suggesting better adaptive behavior under FR. For another, David, there was no clear difference (~45 responses/min in both). This variability suggests individual differences play a role, and VR's benefits may not be universal.

The study detailed specific conditions:  
- FR condition: Token production was FR1 (1 token per response), with exchange after 10 tokens (FR10), session duration 5-10 minutes, actual time including consumption 5'44" to 22'58", with 15/64 sessions stopped early due to behavior.  
- VR condition: Token production FR1, exchange varied 1-18 tokens averaging 10 (VR10), based on an Excel macro from Bancroft and Bourret (2008).  

For Elizabeth, exchanges ranged from 11 (VR) to 58 (reversal to VR), indicating VR might involve more frequent exchanges, potentially affecting motivation.

#### Research Findings on Problem Behavior  
Reducing problem behavior, such as disruptive actions or non-compliance, is crucial in token economies. The deaf children study found VR led to less disruptive behavior compared to FR, supporting the idea that VR's steady responding minimizes pauses where problem behaviors might occur. This is consistent with general principles, as FR's post-reinforcement pauses could provide windows for problem behaviors, as seen in the autism study where 15/64 FR sessions for Elizabeth were stopped early due to behavior, possibly indicating more problem behavior.

For David, no such interruptions were noted, and response rates were similar across conditions, suggesting less problem behavior overall. This inconsistency highlights that individual factors, such as baseline behavior or the function of problem behavior, influence outcomes. The study "Differential effects of token production and exchange on responding of children with developmental disabilities" ([Differential effects of token production and exchange on responding of children with developmental disabilities](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0023969020301879)) found under high schedule requirements, token production (likely FR) suppressed responding compared to yoked reinforcement, suggesting FR might exacerbate problem behavior by signaling long delays to reinforcement.

#### Comparative Analysis and Individual Variability  
Comparing VR and FR, VR seems likely to be more effective overall for reducing problem behavior and promoting adaptive behavior, given its association with steady responding and less pausing. However, the autism study’s mixed results, with Elizabeth showing higher adaptive behavior under FR but potentially more problem behavior, indicate individual variability. This variability is unexpected, as it contrasts with general expectations that VR would consistently outperform FR. It suggests that for some individuals, the predictability of FR might be motivating, while for others, VR’s unpredictability maintains engagement better.

The study with deaf children, involving five students, showed clear benefits of VR, with higher attention and less disruption, reinforcing the theoretical advantage. Participants included Charlie (FR 10, met in ~2-3 minutes), Nile (FR 20), and others, with conditions compared under dense, lean, and yoked reinforcement, further supporting VR’s potential under certain conditions.

#### Practical Implications and Recommendations  
For practitioners, VR schedules might be preferred in token economies to promote consistent adaptive behavior and reduce problem behavior, especially for individuals prone to disruptions during pauses. However, given individual variability, initial assessments and trials with both schedules could help tailor the approach. The study recommendations, such as ensuring consistent reinforcement and exploring higher ratios, suggest flexibility in implementation. For example, starting with dense schedules and thinning them over time, as seen in reviews like "The token economy for children with intellectual disability and/or autism: A review" ([The token economy for children with intellectual disability and/or autism: A review](https://www.academia.edu/5403772/The_token_economy_for_children_with_intellectual_disability_and_or_autism_A_review)), could balance effectiveness.

#### Conclusion  
In summary, research leans toward VR schedules being more effective in token economies for individuals with developmental disabilities, promoting adaptive behavior through steady responding and reducing problem behavior by minimizing pauses. However, individual differences mean outcomes can vary, necessitating personalized approaches. This detailed analysis underscores the importance of considering both theoretical principles and empirical evidence in designing interventions.
