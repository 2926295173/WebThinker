### Key Points
- Research suggests juvenile Lake Sturgeon experience reduced foraging success on usual prey due to Zebra Mussel colonization, particularly when less than 200 mm long, as mussels cover feeding habitats.
- It seems likely that as Lake Sturgeon grow larger, beyond 600-700 mm, they start including Zebra Mussels in their diet, adapting to the invasive species.
- The evidence leans toward adjusting stocking programs to release larger juveniles that can eat Zebra Mussels, enhancing survival in infested areas, and protecting habitats with lower mussel densities for younger stages.

### Ontogenetic Shifts in Diet and Feeding Behavior
Juvenile Lake Sturgeon, especially those under 200 mm in total length, face challenges in foraging on their typical prey, such as chironomids and amphipods, due to Zebra Mussels covering sandy and silty habitats. This physical barrier reduces their access to food, and they tend to avoid areas heavily colonized by mussels, which can limit their growth and survival.

As Lake Sturgeon grow larger, particularly beyond 600-700 mm, they adapt by including Zebra Mussels in their diet. This shift allows them to utilize the abundant mussels as a food source, potentially offsetting the negative impacts experienced earlier in their life cycle.

### Implications for Adaptive Management
Understanding these dietary and behavioral changes is crucial for conserving Lake Sturgeon, an endangered species in the Great Lakes. One key strategy is to stock larger juveniles, around age 1+ or larger, that can consume Zebra Mussels, improving their chances of survival in areas affected by the invasive species. Additionally, protecting or restoring habitats with lower Zebra Mussel densities can support the critical early life stages, ensuring better growth and survival rates for juveniles.

An unexpected detail is that while larger sturgeon can eat Zebra Mussels, these may be less nutritious compared to their usual soft-bodied prey, potentially affecting their long-term health and growth, which managers need to consider in conservation planning.

### Survey Note: Detailed Analysis of Ontogenetic Shifts and Management Strategies for Lake Sturgeon in Response to Zebra Mussel Invasion

This detailed analysis explores the specific ontogenetic shifts in the diet and feeding behavior of juvenile Lake Sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens) in response to the colonization of their native spawning habitats by invasive Zebra Mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) in the Great Lakes, and how these changes can inform adaptive management strategies for conserving this endangered species. The findings are grounded in scientific literature and recovery plans, providing a comprehensive overview for conservation practitioners and researchers.

#### Background on Lake Sturgeon and Zebra Mussels
Lake Sturgeon, a long-lived, slow-growing species native to the Great Lakes, have faced significant population declines due to overfishing, habitat loss, and invasive species. Zebra Mussels, first detected in the Great Lakes in the 1980s, have colonized sandy and silty habitats, altering ecosystem dynamics by filtering large volumes of water and affecting prey availability. This invasion poses particular challenges for juvenile Lake Sturgeon, which rely on these habitats for foraging during their early life stages.

#### Ontogenetic Shifts in Diet and Feeding Behavior
Research indicates that juvenile Lake Sturgeon, particularly those less than 200 mm in total length, experience significant reductions in foraging success due to Zebra Mussel colonization. A study by McCabe et al. (2006) found that foraging on chironomids was virtually eliminated with 95% Zebra Mussel cover and significantly reduced with 50% cover, while foraging on more mobile prey like amphipods and isopods was essentially eliminated at both coverage levels. This is attributed to the physical barrier created by Zebra Mussel colonies, which cover the substrate and provide refuge for prey, making it difficult for small juveniles to access their preferred food sources.

The study also noted that juvenile Lake Sturgeon, with a mean total length of 167 mm (range 136–186 mm), primarily forage for macroinvertebrates like burrowing mayflies (Hexagenia) and amphipods, but their habitat choice experiments showed they avoided Zebra-Mussel-covered areas more than 90% of the time, preferring sand (65.7%) and gravel (25.8%) habitats. This avoidance behavior further limits their feeding opportunities in colonized areas.

As Lake Sturgeon grow larger, specifically beyond 600-700 mm in total length, there is a notable dietary shift. McCabe et al. (2006) and supporting diet work by Jackson et al. (2002) suggest that larger sturgeon (>600 mm TL) begin to include Zebra Mussels in their diet, potentially utilizing them as a significant food source. This adaptation is evident in studies from the St. Clair River, where Zebra Mussels were found to be the most abundant food item in the stomachs of larger Lake Sturgeon. This shift is likely facilitated by their ability to consume whole mussels, given their sucker-type mouth, which can vacuum up small organisms, including mussels of 1-2 cm in size.

However, it is important to note that while larger sturgeon can consume Zebra Mussels, their nutritional value may be lower compared to soft-bodied prey like dipteran larvae. Wisconsin Sea Grant research highlights that Zebra Mussels have an energy density four times lower than preferred prey like Diporeia, potentially leading to slower growth and reduced health for sturgeon relying on them, which adds complexity to their dietary adaptation.

| Life Stage | Total Length (TL) | Diet and Feeding Behavior | Impact of Zebra Mussels |
|------------|-------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------|
| Juvenile (<200 mm) | 136–186 mm (mean 167 mm) | Forage on chironomids, amphipods, isopods; avoid colonized habitats | Reduced foraging success, limited prey access |
| Larger Juvenile/Adult (>600-700 mm) | >600 mm | Include Zebra Mussels in diet; target dreissenids | Utilize mussels as food source, potential nutritional trade-off |

#### Implications for Adaptive Management Strategies
The ontogenetic shifts in diet and feeding behavior have significant implications for the conservation of Lake Sturgeon, listed as threatened or endangered in much of its range. Adaptive management strategies must account for the differential impacts on juvenile and larger life stages to enhance recovery efforts.

One key strategy is adjusting stocking programs to release larger Lake Sturgeon that can utilize Zebra Mussels as a food source. McCabe et al. (2006) recommend focusing stocking efforts on individuals aged 1+ or larger, as these fish are more likely to survive in Zebra-Mussel-infested areas by consuming the mussels. Typical stocking practices involve rearing sturgeon in streamside facilities to sizes where they are less vulnerable to predators, often as fingerlings (around 127–178 mm at five months) or yearlings, which may be around 254–305 mm at age 1, based on growth estimates. However, to align with the dietary shift, stocking larger juveniles closer to 600 mm or more could improve survival rates, though this may require extended rearing periods, increasing costs and logistical challenges.

Another strategy involves protecting and restoring habitats with lower Zebra Mussel densities to support juvenile survival. The Ontario Lake Sturgeon Recovery Strategy (2018) identifies species invasions, including Zebra Mussels, as a threat, noting that heavy infestations reduce habitat suitability by limiting prey availability, particularly for juveniles. Management actions could include assessing local impediments, such as controlling mussel spread in critical spawning areas, and implementing habitat enhancements like removing low-head barriers, while considering the ecological risks of upstream invasive species movement.

Additionally, monitoring and research are essential to understand the long-term impacts of Zebra Mussel consumption on Lake Sturgeon health. Given the lower nutritional value of mussels, conservation efforts should evaluate growth rates and body condition of stocked fish to ensure they thrive post-release. This may involve integrating genetic and ecological studies to select donor populations and stocking sites that minimize competition and maximize survival in altered ecosystems.

#### Broader Context and Challenges
The presence of Zebra Mussels in the Great Lakes, estimated at 750 trillion in some reports, poses a widespread challenge, affecting not only Lake Sturgeon but also other species like lake whitefish and native mussels. While larger Lake Sturgeon can adapt by consuming mussels, the overall ecosystem shift, including reduced plankton and nutrient availability, complicates recovery efforts. Recovery plans, such as the New York Lake Sturgeon Recovery Plan (2018–2024), mention Zebra Mussels as part of the diet but do not detail specific management responses, highlighting the need for integrated approaches that address multiple threats, including habitat alteration, pollution, and illegal harvest.

An unexpected detail is the potential role of other invasive species, like round gobies, which also consume Zebra Mussels and may indirectly benefit Lake Sturgeon by reducing mussel densities. However, this interaction is complex, as gobies compete for resources and may affect prey availability, adding another layer to ecosystem management.

In conclusion, the ontogenetic shifts in Lake Sturgeon diet and feeding behavior in response to Zebra Mussel colonization underscore the importance of tailored conservation strategies. By focusing on stocking larger juveniles, protecting critical habitats, and conducting ongoing research, managers can mitigate the impacts of invasive species and support the recovery of Lake Sturgeon populations in the Great Lakes, ensuring their long-term survival and ecological role.
