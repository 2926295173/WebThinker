### Key Points
- Research suggests DBT can be adapted for clients with BPD and high-functioning autism, focusing on concrete language and structured sessions.
- It seems likely that individual and group skills training can be modified to address rigid thinking and social interaction challenges.
- The evidence leans toward using visual aids, sensory activities, and client interests to enhance engagement.

### Adapting DBT Skills Training
To effectively adapt DBT skills training, consider using clear, concrete language and visual aids to make skills more accessible, especially for rigid thinking patterns. Break down skills into smaller parts, focus on one topic at a time, and allow extra practice time to accommodate processing differences. Incorporate sensory activities, like weighted blankets, tailored to the client's needs to help with emotion regulation. Integrating the client's special interests can boost motivation and engagement.

### Addressing Group Social Interactions
For group skills training, ensure a structured format with clear agendas and timings to reduce anxiety. Adapt communication to be direct and accommodate diverse needs, and consider involving a support person if beneficial. If group settings are too challenging, individual skills training can be an alternative, ensuring the client is comfortable with the chosen format.

### Unexpected Detail: Sensory Considerations
An unexpected aspect is the importance of sensory activities, such as using a weighted blanket instead of typical DBT suggestions like ice dives, which may trigger hypersensitivities in autistic clients, enhancing the therapy's effectiveness.

### Survey Note: Comprehensive Analysis of Adapting DBT for Co-occurring BPD and High-Functioning Autism

This note provides a detailed examination of adapting Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) skills training for a client with co-occurring Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) and high-functioning autism, addressing the unique challenges of rigid thinking patterns and difficulty with group social interactions. The analysis is informed by recent research and clinical guidelines, ensuring a thorough understanding for mental health professionals.

#### Background and Context
DBT, developed by Marsha Linehan, is a structured outpatient treatment primarily designed for BPD, focusing on skills like emotion regulation, distress tolerance, interpersonal effectiveness, and mindfulness. It typically includes individual therapy, group skills training, telephone consultation, and therapist consultation teams. However, for clients with co-occurring high-functioning autism (often referred to as Autism Spectrum Disorder [ASD] level 1, without intellectual disability), additional adaptations are necessary due to challenges in social communication, flexibility in thinking, and sensory sensitivities.

Research indicates a 4% prevalence rate of ASD in persons with BPD, highlighting the need for tailored interventions. The co-occurrence presents unique challenges, as BPD involves intense emotional experiences and difficulty regulating emotions, while autism can exacerbate social interaction difficulties and rigid thinking patterns. This analysis draws on studies and guidelines to propose effective adaptations, ensuring the therapy meets the client's needs.

#### Individual Adaptations for DBT Skills Training
To address the client's rigid thinking patterns and processing differences, several adaptations are recommended:

- **Concrete Language and Visual Aids:** Use clear, concrete language and visual depictions for DBT skills to enhance comprehension. For example, renaming abstract concepts like "making lemonade out of lemons" with concrete terms and accompanying images can help, as suggested by a 2023 study on co-occurring ASD and BPD ([Co-Occurring Autism Spectrum and Borderline Personality Disorder: An Emerging Clinical Challenge Seeking Informed Interventions](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9997622/)).

- **Simplified Handouts and Focused Practice:** Focus on one topic at a time, using simplified handouts with minimal text, and provide extra time for skills practice. This accommodates slower processing speeds, as noted in the same study.

- **Sensory Activities:** Incorporate sensory activities tailored to the client's sensory profile, such as using a weighted blanket, which may be more effective than typical DBT suggestions like ice dives that could trigger hypersensitivities. This adaptation is supported by research indicating sensory sensitivities in ASD ([Co-Occurring Autism Spectrum and Borderline Personality Disorder: An Emerging Clinical Challenge Seeking Informed Interventions](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9997622/)).

- **Integrating Client Interests:** Leverage the client's restricted or strong interests to increase therapy motivation, such as using these interests to reinforce effective interpersonal behavior. This approach was found to enhance engagement in a pilot study for adapted DBT for ASD without intellectual disability ([Adapting Dialectical Behavior Therapy for Autistic Adults: A Pilot Study](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10803-021-05317-w)).

- **Behavior Chain Analysis:** Use simplified DBT behavior chain analysis to help identify sensory antecedents and consequences of behaviors like self-injury, making it more accessible for clients with autism.

These adaptations ensure the therapy is accessible and effective, addressing both BPD and autism-related challenges.

#### Group Skills Training Adaptations
Given the client's difficulty with group social interactions, adaptations to the group component of DBT are crucial. Group skills training, typically involving 2.5-hour sessions twice weekly in some studies, can be modified as follows:

- **Structured Format and Predictability:** Set clear agendas with timings to manage predictability and participation, reducing anxiety. This is supported by the Good Practice Guide for Professionals Delivering Talking Therapies for Autistic Adults and Children, which recommends structured sessions for group therapy ([Good Practice Guide for Professionals Delivering Talking Therapies for Autistic Adults and Children](https://s2.chorus-mk.thirdlight.com/file/24/asDKIN9as.klK7easFDsalAzTC/NAS-Good-Practice-Guide-A4.pdf)).

- **Communication Adaptations:** Use direct language and flexible delivery methods, such as drawing or role-playing, to accommodate diverse communication needs. This helps reduce overload in group settings, as suggested in the guide.

- **Support for Social Anxiety:** Address individual barriers like anxiety in group settings through pre-treatment psychoeducation and problem-solving. Offer accompaniment to the group therapy room and normalize anxiety in the first session via activities like anonymous 1-4 scale ratings, as seen in a pilot study for DBT with autistic adults ([Adapting Dialectical Behavior Therapy for Autistic Adults: A Pilot Study](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10803-021-05317-w)).

- **Involving Advocates:** Consider involving chosen advocates to support communication and embed strategies, enhancing group therapy effectiveness, especially for autistic children and adults, as per the guide ([Good Practice Guide for Professionals Delivering Talking Therapies for Autistic Adults and Children](https://s2.chorus-mk.thirdlight.com/file/24/asDKIN9as.klK7easFDsalAzTC/NAS-Good-Practice-Guide-A4.pdf)).

- **Incorporating Interests:** Integrate the client's interests meaningfully to build rapport and engagement in group settings, improving therapeutic relationships, as recommended in the guide.

- **Frequency Adjustments:** Increase the frequency of skills training to twice weekly, as seen in the DIASS study protocol, to accommodate the preference for repetitive instructions in ASD ([The effect of dialectical behaviour therapy in autism spectrum patients with suicidality and/ or self-destructive behaviour (DIASS): study protocol](https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12888-020-02531-1)).

If group settings remain too challenging, consider offering individual skills training as an alternative, ensuring the client is involved in deciding the format, aligning with person-centered approaches.

#### Environmental and Cognitive Considerations
To further address rigid thinking patterns, maintain a stable therapy environment by using the same room, layout, schedule, and facilitators. Ritualize individual sessions to provide predictability, as suggested in a pilot study for DBT with autistic adults ([Adapting Dialectical Behavior Therapy for Autistic Adults: A Pilot Study](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10803-021-05317-w)). This stability can help reduce anxiety and enhance focus, particularly in group settings.

#### Evidence and Support
These adaptations are supported by recent research, including a pilot study demonstrating preliminary efficacy of adapted DBT for ASD without intellectual disability ([Adapting Dialectical Behavior Therapy for Autistic Adults: A Pilot Study](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10803-021-05317-w)) and the Good Practice Guide, informed by 1,580 autistic adults and 900 family members ([Good Practice Guide for Professionals Delivering Talking Therapies for Autistic Adults and Children](https://s2.chorus-mk.thirdlight.com/file/24/asDKIN9as.klK7easFDsalAzTC/NAS-Good-Practice-Guide-A4.pdf)). The DIASS trial also provides insights into group therapy adaptations, emphasizing twice-weekly sessions ([The effect of dialectical behaviour therapy in autism spectrum patients with suicidality and/ or self-destructive behaviour (DIASS): study protocol](https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12888-020-02531-1)).
