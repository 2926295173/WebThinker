### Survey Note: Comprehensive Adaptation of Easy Does It for Fluency Therapy with Co-occurring Apraxia and Mindfulness in Group Settings

This note provides a detailed exploration of adapting the Easy Does It approach to fluency therapy for a client with co-occurring apraxia of speech, while incorporating mindfulness-based strategies to reduce anxiety and increase self-awareness, specifically in a group treatment setting for children aged 8-12. The discussion is grounded in available resources and aims to offer a professional, evidence-based perspective.

#### Background on Easy Does It Approach
The Easy Does It for Fluency: Intermediate program, designed for children aged 6-12, is a structured fluency therapy approach emphasizing forward flowing speech and word-initiation techniques such as bouncing, sliding, easy onsets, and light contacts ([Easy Does It for Fluency: Intermediate](https://www.proedinc.com/Products/31090/easy-does-it-for-fluency-intermediate.aspx)). It includes six levels: Getting Ready (education and commitment), Analyzing (differentiating easy disfluencies from stuttering), Modifying Speech Production (using easy speech techniques), Desensitizing (tolerating fluency disruptors), Transferring (applying skills in real-life settings), and Maintaining (phasing out therapy). The program addresses motor (rate control, continuous phonation), linguistic (problem solving, conversation), and psychosocial (positive attitudes, desensitization) components, with detailed lesson plans and activities for student practice.

Given the target age group of 8-12 aligns with the intermediate version, this program serves as a foundation for adaptation. The approach is particularly suited for fluency shaping, aiming to develop fluent speech through modeling and hierarchical progression.

#### Addressing Co-occurring Apraxia of Speech
Apraxia of speech is a motor speech disorder involving difficulty with planning and coordinating speech movements, often requiring intensive practice and multisensory cues. For a client with co-occurring fluency issues (likely stuttering) and apraxia, therapy must integrate strategies from both domains. Research suggests that children with apraxia may experience phases of "system overload" during therapy, where speech motor complexity exceeds capacity, potentially leading to disfluency ([Stuttering and Dysfluency - Apraxia Kids](https://www.apraxia-kids.org/apraxia_kids_library/stuttering-and-dysfluency/)). This indicates a need for careful pacing and modification.

To adapt Easy Does It, consider the following:
- **Motor Planning Support:** Incorporate rhythmic speech (e.g., using a metronome or tapping) and multisensory cues (visual aids, tactile feedback) to aid motor sequencing. For instance, during the Modifying Speech Production level, practice easy onsets with visual prompts showing articulatory movements.
- **Task Breakdown:** Break down speech tasks into smaller units, such as practicing syllables before words, to reduce cognitive load. This aligns with apraxia therapy principles of repetitive practice starting with simple sounds.
- **Individual Modifications:** In group settings, provide additional support for the client with apraxia, such as slower pacing or individualized drills, while ensuring they can participate in group activities at their level.

#### Incorporating Mindfulness-Based Strategies
Mindfulness, defined as focusing on the present moment without judgment, can reduce anxiety and enhance self-awareness, particularly beneficial for children with speech disorders ([How Can Mindfulness Help With Speech Therapy?](https://solspeechandlanguage.com/how-can-mindfulness-help-with-speech-therapy/)). Research indicates that mindfulness practices, such as breathing exercises, improve attention and participation in therapy, essential for language development ([Speech Therapist and Mindfulness Leader Melanie Pensak](https://www.rachelmadel.com/blog/qampa-with-speech-therapist-and-mindfulness-leader-melanie-pensak)). For children aged 8-12, mindfulness can be age-appropriate through activities like guided imagery, body scans, and mindful listening.

To integrate mindfulness into the Easy Does It program:
- **Session Starters:** Begin each session with a short mindfulness exercise, such as a one-minute mindful breathing activity, to calm the group and prepare for therapy.
- **Anxiety Management:** Teach children to use mindfulness techniques, like focusing on breath, during speech practice to manage anxiety. This can be particularly helpful in the Desensitizing level, where children learn to tolerate fluency disruptors.
- **Self-Awareness Activities:** Encourage children to observe their speech without judgment, using exercises like rating their fluency or reflecting on how techniques feel. This can be supported by maintaining a speech journal, aligning with the program's self-monitoring component.
- **Engaging Methods:** Use fun mindfulness activities, such as sensory games (e.g., savoring snacks) or appreciation practices (naming "Three Good Things"), to keep children engaged ([Mindfulness for Kids](https://www.mindful.org/mindfulness-for-kids/)).

#### Group Treatment Setting Considerations
In a group setting, therapy must balance individual needs with collective engagement. The Easy Does It programâ€™s group-friendly activities, such as games and peer modeling, can be leveraged, with modifications for the client with apraxia. Key strategies include:
- **Interactive Activities:** Use games like turn-taking for practicing easy onsets or role-playing real-life scenarios (e.g., ordering food) to practice transferring skills. These activities foster peer support and feedback, enhancing motivation.
- **Peer Modeling:** Encourage children without apraxia to model fluent speech, providing a supportive environment for the client with apraxia to learn and participate.
- **Flexible Pacing:** Ensure group activities are adaptable, allowing the therapist to provide additional cues or slower pacing for the client with apraxia while keeping the group engaged.
- **Psychosocial Benefits:** Group settings can boost confidence through peer encouragement, addressing the psychosocial component of the program. Activities that build positive attitudes, such as discussing feelings about communication, can be included.

#### Detailed Implementation Plan
To operationalize these adaptations, consider the following structured approach, mapped to the Easy Does It levels:

This table ensures a comprehensive approach, balancing fluency, apraxia, and mindfulness needs.

#### Expected Outcomes and Considerations
Research suggests that integrating these strategies can improve speech fluency, reduce anxiety, and enhance self-awareness, particularly in group settings where peer support is a factor ([Fluency Disorders](https://www.asha.org/practice-portal/clinical-topics/fluency-disorders/)). An unexpected benefit is the potential for increased confidence through peer interactions, which may extend beyond therapy to social settings. However, the complexity of co-occurring disorders requires ongoing assessment to adjust strategies, ensuring the client with apraxia progresses without feeling overwhelmed.

In conclusion, adapting the Easy Does It approach with motor planning techniques for apraxia and mindfulness strategies for anxiety management, within a group setting, offers a holistic therapy framework. This approach leverages the program's structure while addressing individual needs, fostering a supportive environment for children aged 8-12 to enhance communication skills.
