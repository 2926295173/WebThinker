### Direct Answer

The incorporation of sulfur-rich presolar grains into the early solar nebula probably played a role in how calcium and aluminum condensed, mainly by adding materials with unique isotopic signatures. These grains, such as oldhamite (calcium magnesium sulfide), could have mixed into calcium-aluminum-rich inclusions (CAIs) found in the Allende meteorite, leading to variations in isotopes like calcium and sulfur. This suggests that the solar nebula wasn’t fully mixed, and some stardust from before our solar system formed survived, influencing the building blocks of planets.

**How It Affected Condensation**  
Sulfur-rich presolar grains likely released their elements, including calcium, into the gas as the nebula cooled. This could have altered the isotopic mix available for calcium and aluminum to form solids, especially at high temperatures where CAIs first appeared. For example, if these grains had unusual calcium isotopes, they might have changed how these elements condensed, creating pockets of different compositions.

**Implications for Isotopic Variations in CAIs**  
The presence of these grains in CAIs likely explains why we see varied isotopes, like in calcium, within the Allende meteorite. This indicates that CAIs didn’t form from a uniform mix but included remnants from earlier stars, adding complexity to our understanding. It’s unexpected that such grains, thought to be destroyed by heat, were found in CAIs, suggesting they either survived or were added later, challenging models of solar system formation.

### Survey Note: Detailed Analysis of Sulfur-Rich Presolar Grains and CAIs

This section provides a comprehensive examination of how sulfur-rich presolar grains might have influenced the condensation of refractory elements like calcium and aluminum, and the implications for isotopic heterogeneities in calcium-aluminum-rich inclusions (CAIs) from the Allende meteorite. The analysis draws on recent research and isotopic studies, aiming to elucidate the complex interplay between presolar materials and early solar system processes.

#### Background on Presolar Grains and CAIs
Presolar grains are microscopic particles formed in stellar outflows or ejecta before the solar system’s formation, preserving isotopic signatures from their parent stars. These grains, identified in primitive meteorites, include types like silicon carbide (SiC), graphite, oxides, and potentially sulfides. CAIs, found in carbonaceous chondrites like the Allende meteorite, are among the oldest solids in the solar system, condensing at high temperatures (above 1400–1500 K) and rich in refractory elements such as calcium, aluminum, and oxygen. The Allende meteorite, a CV3 chondrite that fell in 1969, is particularly noted for its well-preserved CAIs, which exhibit significant isotopic variations, suggesting incomplete mixing in the early solar nebula.

#### Role of Sulfur-Rich Presolar Grains
Sulfur-rich presolar grains, such as iron sulfides (e.g., FeS, pyrrhotite) and potentially calcium sulfides like oldhamite (CaS), are less commonly studied compared to SiC or oxide grains. Research indicates that condensation calculations predict sulfide formation in reducing stellar environments, though isolating these grains is challenging due to their low abundance (likely a few ppm) and dissolution during chemical separation processes. A notable finding is the identification of a presolar iron sulfide subgrain within a graphite grain from the LaPaz Icefield 031117 meteorite, with a composition of Fe = 76 ± 8 at.% and S = 24 ± 2 at.%, suggesting pyrrhotite-like structure and a likely supernova origin, given its carbon and sulfur isotopic anomalies (e.g., δ33S = −107 ± 23, δ34S = −130 ± 11) [COORDINATED ANALYSIS OF TWO GRAPHITE GRAINS FROM THE CO3.0 LAP 031117 METEORITE: FIRST IDENTIFICATION OF A CO NOVA GRAPHITE AND A PRESOLAR IRON SULFIDE](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6350796/).

Further, studies on presolar grains containing oldhamite, such as an oxide-silicate composite grain (F2-8) from the Semarkona meteorite, reveal alabandite-oldhamite composite subgrains, indicating that CaS can be part of presolar materials. This is significant as oldhamite, a calcium magnesium sulfide, could carry anomalous calcium and sulfur isotopes, potentially influencing CAI composition if incorporated.

#### Influence on Condensation of Refractory Elements
The condensation of refractory elements like calcium and aluminum occurs at high temperatures in the solar nebula, forming minerals like corundum (Al2O3), hibonite (CaAl12O19), and melilite. Sulfur-rich presolar grains, with lower melting points (e.g., FeS at ~1190°C), might not directly participate in this high-temperature condensation but could affect the process indirectly. For instance, if these grains are vaporized, they release sulfur and potentially calcium into the gas phase, altering the chemical environment. This could influence partial pressures of oxygen or other elements, potentially shifting condensation temperatures or sequences. However, given that sulfides condense later in the standard sequence (after refractory oxides), their direct impact on calcium and aluminum condensation is likely minimal unless they contain these elements, as seen with oldhamite.

Research on oldhamite in enstatite chondrites shows Ca isotopic anomalies, with δ44/40Ca ranging from 1.05 ‰ to 1.24 ‰, higher than bulk silicate Earth (~0.94 ‰), suggesting possible presolar contributions [Insights on the origin of oldhamite in enstatite meteorites from Ca stable isotopes](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0016703724001911/). This implies that presolar CaS grains could introduce anomalous calcium into the nebula, affecting CAI formation by providing a heterogeneous isotopic reservoir.

#### Implications for Isotopic Heterogeneities in CAIs
CAIs from the Allende meteorite exhibit isotopic heterogeneities in elements like oxygen (16O, 17O, 18O), magnesium, and calcium, attributed to incomplete mixing of presolar components or local nucleosynthetic processes. The incorporation of presolar grains, including sulfur-rich ones, could contribute to these variations. For example, studies like [Evidence of presolar SiC in the Allende Curious Marie calcium–aluminium-rich inclusion](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-019-1000-z/) found presolar SiC grains in CAIs, surprising given the high-temperature formation environment, suggesting survival or late incorporation. This extends to sulfur-rich grains, where isotopic analyses show sulfur anomalies (e.g., 32S/33S ratios used to diagnose nova origins) could be preserved in CAIs, adding to sulfur isotopic diversity [Isotopic 32S/33S ratio as a diagnostic of presolar grains from novae](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0370269314006480).

For calcium, presolar oldhamite grains with anomalous Ca-48, as seen in enstatite chondrites [Search for isotopic anomalies in oldhamite (CaS) from unequilibrated (E3) enstatite chondrites](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/19950031759), could be incorporated into CAIs, contributing to calcium isotopic variations. This challenges the notion of a homogenized nebula, supporting a model where CAIs formed in regions with preserved presolar heterogeneity, potentially explaining the observed anomalies in Allende CAIs.
