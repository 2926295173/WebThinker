### Survey Note: Detailed Integration of Exopaleontology into Middle School Astrobiology Curriculum

This note provides a comprehensive approach to integrating exopaleontology, specifically the potential for fossilized evidence of extinct extraterrestrial life, into a middle school astrobiology curriculum. It emphasizes storytelling techniques to engage students and encourage creative thinking about life beyond Earth, drawing on extensive research and educational resources.

#### Background and Definitions
Exopaleontology is defined as the study of fossilized evidence of past life on other planets, with a primary focus on Mars due to its geological history and ongoing exploration. Astrobiology, encompassing the study of life in the universe, includes the search for extraterrestrial life and the conditions that support it. For middle school students, exopaleontology can be introduced as part of the broader astrobiology curriculum, particularly within units on the search for life in our solar system.

Research indicates that astrobiology curricula typically cover topics such as the definition of life, conditions necessary for life, extremophiles on Earth, and the exploration of Mars and other celestial bodies. Exopaleontology fits naturally into the section on Mars, given missions like NASA's Perseverance rover, which aims to collect samples for potential signs of past microbial life.

#### Curriculum Integration Strategy
To integrate exopaleontology effectively, the curriculum can be structured as follows:

1. **Introduction to Astrobiology and Exopaleontology:**
   - Begin with a definition of astrobiology, highlighting its interdisciplinary nature, including biology, astronomy, and geology. Explain that it seeks to answer whether life exists beyond Earth.
   - Introduce exopaleontology as the search for fossilized evidence, focusing on Mars due to its past water activity and current exploration efforts. For example, discuss how Mars once had lakes and rivers, making it a prime candidate for fossilized life.

2. **Understanding Fossils and Their Formation:**
   - Teach students about fossils on Earth, explaining how they form through processes like mineralization and preservation in sedimentary rocks. Use examples like dinosaur bones or amber-trapped insects to make it relatable.
   - Hypothesize how fossils might form on Mars, considering its dry, cold environment. Discuss the role of ancient lake beds, like those in Jezero Crater, where Perseverance landed, as potential sites for fossil preservation.

3. **Exploring Current Missions:**
   - Highlight the Perseverance rover mission, launched in July 2020 and landing on February 18, 2021, in Jezero Crater. Explain its objectives, including collecting rock and regolith samples for future Earth analysis, with a focus on finding biosignatures.
   - Use multimedia resources, such as videos from [Perseverance Rover Videos](https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/multimedia/videos/), to show the rover's descent, landing, and exploration. These videos, including time-lapse footage of instrument operations, can illustrate the scientific process and engage visual learners.

4. **Storytelling Techniques for Engagement:**
   - Implement storytelling by creating narratives where students are part of a Mars mission team. For instance, develop a scenario where they must analyze rock samples for fossilized microbes, facing challenges like limited resources or harsh conditions.
   - Use role-playing to assign roles such as geologist, biologist, or engineer, fostering collaboration. This approach helps students understand the interdisciplinary nature of exopaleontology and encourages empathy for scientific teamwork.
   - Incorporate real stories from scientists, such as Dr. Kennda Lynch, an astrobiologist working on Mars analogs, or Ken Farley, the Perseverance project scientist, to add authenticity. Interviews, like those on [Planetary Radio](https://www.planetary.org/planetary-radio/2022-ken-farley-perseverance), can be adapted for classroom use to inspire students.

5. **Interactive and Hands-On Activities:**
   - Utilize NASA's educational resources, such as the "Learning Resources" page ([Perseverance Learning Resources](https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/participate/name-the-rover/learning-resources/)), which offers lesson plans on Mars exploration, rover design, and astrobiology. Activities include building model spacecraft and classifying crustal materials, which can be adapted to include exopaleontology.
   - Engage students with the "Explore Mars: A Mars Rover Game" ([Explore Mars Game](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/explore-mars/en/)), where they control a virtual rover, choose rocks to investigate, and earn points for analyzing samples. This game, guided by the voice of Charlene Pfeifer, an engineer on the Mars 2020 mission, simulates the scientific process and reinforces learning.
   - Consider simulations like "Rover Mechanic Simulator - Perseverance Rover DLC" ([Rover Mechanic Simulator](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1512110/Rover_Mechanic_Simulator__Perseverance_Rover_DLC/)), which, while more advanced, can inspire classroom discussions on rover maintenance and scientific instruments.

6. **Analyzing Samples and Encouraging Creativity:**
   - Provide students with images or simulated rock samples to examine for potential biosignatures, such as mineral patterns or organic compounds. Discuss criteria scientists use, like the presence of carbonates or clay, to identify past life.
   - Encourage creative projects, such as writing stories or creating comics about the Perseverance rover's discoveries. For example, students can imagine finding a fossilized microbe and speculate on its implications, blending scientific facts with imaginative narratives.
   - Facilitate group presentations where students share their findings, fostering public speaking skills and peer learning.

7. **Reflection and Discussion:**
   - Conclude with discussions on the implications of finding fossilized life on Mars, such as how it would reshape our understanding of life's distribution in the universe. Encourage students to consider ethical questions, like the impact on space exploration policies.
   - Reflect on the future of exopaleontology, including planned missions like Mars Sample Return, expected around 2030, which could bring Martian samples to Earth for detailed analysis.

#### Engagement and Creative Thinking
To ensure engagement, storytelling should be dynamic and interactive.
