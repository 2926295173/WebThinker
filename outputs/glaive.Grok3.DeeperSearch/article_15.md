### Key Points
- It seems likely that upgrading to Rails 7.0.1 or later will resolve the "cannot load such file -- net/smtp" error when running RSpec tests after upgrading to Rails 7 and Ruby 3.1.
- Research suggests that this error occurs because `net-smtp` became a default gem in Ruby 3.1, and Rails 7.0.0 had issues with loading it, fixed in version 7.0.1.
- The evidence leans toward updating your Gemfile to specify `gem 'rails', '~> 7.0.1'` and running `bundle update rails` to fix the issue.

### Steps to Resolve the Issue
**Update Rails Version:**
- Open your `Gemfile` and change the Rails gem line to:
  ```ruby
  gem 'rails', '~> 7.0.1'
  ```
- Run the command `bundle update rails` in your terminal to update Rails to at least version 7.0.1.

**Run Tests Again:**
- After the update, run your tests with RSpec. The error should no longer appear, as Rails 7.0.1 includes fixes for loading `net-smtp`.

**Unexpected Detail:**
- You might not expect that simply updating Rails could fix a Ruby library loading issue, but this is due to Rails 7.0.1 adding `net-smtp` and related gems as dependencies, ensuring they are available during tests.

### Survey Note: Detailed Analysis of the Rails 7 and Ruby 3.1 `net/smtp` Error

This section provides a comprehensive examination of the issue encountered when running RSpec tests after upgrading to Rails 7 and Ruby 3.1, specifically the error "cannot load such file -- net/smtp." The analysis covers the root cause, solution, and additional context to ensure a thorough understanding for developers facing similar challenges.

#### Background and Root Cause
The error arises due to changes in Ruby 3.1, where several standard libraries, including `net/smtp`, were transitioned to default gems. In Ruby versions prior to 3.0, `net/smtp` was part of the standard library, accessible without explicit gem installation. However, in Ruby 3.1, it became a default gem, meaning it is included with Ruby but may require explicit requiring in certain environments, such as during testing with RSpec in a Rails application.

The issue is particularly pronounced in Rails 7.0.0, where the framework's dependency management did not initially account for these changes, leading to failures in loading `net/smtp` during test runs. This is evident from community reports, such as a Stack Overflow post detailing the same error in a Rails 7 and Ruby 3.1 setup, which highlighted that the `mail` gem (used by Action Mailer) attempted to load `net/smtp` but failed.

#### Solution and Implementation
The primary solution, as identified from community discussions and official Rails documentation, is to upgrade Rails to version 7.0.1 or later. This version, released on January 6, 2022, includes a commit that adds `net-smtp`, `net-imap`, and `net-pop` as dependencies in the gemspecs for `actionmailbox` and `actionmailer`. This ensures that these gems are properly loaded during application initialization, including test environments.

To implement this fix:
1. Open the `Gemfile` and update the Rails gem specification to:
   ```ruby
   gem 'rails', '~> 7.0.1'
   ```
2. Run `bundle update rails` to update the Rails gem and its dependencies.
3. After the update, rerun your RSpec tests. The error should be resolved, as Rails 7.0.1 ensures the necessary gems are available.

This approach is supported by a Stack Overflow answer that recommends upgrading to Rails >= 7.0.1 for Rails 7 users, with a specific link to the Rails blog post announcing the 7.0.1 release, which confirms the fix.

#### Additional Context and Considerations
While upgrading Rails is the recommended solution, it's worth noting that `net-smtp` is a default gem in Ruby 3.1, meaning it should theoretically be available without adding it to the Gemfile. However, in practice, Rails applications using Bundler may encounter issues due to how dependencies are loaded in test environments. The commit in Rails 7.0.1 addresses this by explicitly including these gems, ensuring compatibility.

For comparison, in Rails 6, a workaround was to manually add `gem 'net-smtp', require: false` and similar entries for `net-imap` and `net-pop` to the Gemfile, or update the `mail` gem to version 2.8.0 or later, which internally handles these dependencies. However, given the user's context of Rails 7, upgrading Rails is the more straightforward and future-proof solution.

The fix in Rails 7.0.1 is part of a broader effort to handle the transition of Ruby standard libraries to gems, as evidenced by documentation on [Standard Gems](https://stdgems.org/) and Ruby issue tracking, which lists `net/smtp` among libraries promoted to default gems in Ruby 3.1. This change was discussed in a Ruby issue tracker post, confirming that `net/smtp` and related libraries were made default gems, requiring framework adjustments like those in Rails 7.0.1.

#### Table: Comparison of Solutions by Rails Version

| Rails Version | Solution                                                                                     | Notes                                                                 |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 6             | Add to Gemfile: `gem 'net-smtp', require: false`, etc.; or update `mail` gem to >= 2.8.0     | Suitable for older versions; requires manual gem management.          |
| 7.0.0         | Upgrade to Rails >= 7.0.1 (released Jan 6, 2022)                                             | Recommended; fixes dependency loading in test environments.           |
| 7.0.1+        | No additional action needed; issue resolved by default                                       | Includes `net-smtp` and related gems as dependencies.                 |

This table highlights that for Rails 7 users, upgrading is the most effective approach, aligning with the current best practices as of March 26, 2025.

#### Unexpected Findings
An interesting detail is that the fix in Rails 7.0.1 does not require manual gem additions, which might be unexpected for developers accustomed to managing such dependencies explicitly. Instead, the framework handles it internally, simplifying the upgrade process but requiring awareness of the version-specific fix.

#### Conclusion
In summary, the "cannot load such file -- net/smtp" error in Rails 7 and Ruby 3.1 during RSpec tests is likely resolved by upgrading to Rails 7.0.1 or later. This update ensures proper loading of `net-smtp` and related gems, addressing the root cause efficiently. Developers should update their Gemfile, run `bundle update rails`, and verify test functionality, leveraging the framework's improved dependency management.
