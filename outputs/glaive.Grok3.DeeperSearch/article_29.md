### Key Points
- Research suggests the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) pipeline expansion could worsen habitat fragmentation for the Asiatic cheetah, potentially increasing human-wildlife conflict.
- It seems likely that associated infrastructure, like new pumping stations, may degrade habitats in the southeastern foothills of the Greater Caucasus Mountains.
- The evidence leans toward expansion impacting prey availability, further threatening the critically endangered cheetah population.

### Overview
The planned expansion of the BTC pipeline, aimed at increasing oil transport, could have significant environmental impacts on the habitats of the Asiatic cheetah, assumed to be present in the southeastern foothills of the Greater Caucasus Mountains. While there are no current cheetah populations in this region, the question implies a hypothetical or potential future scenario, such as reintroduction. This expansion may lead to habitat loss, increased human activity, and conflicts, all of which could cascade into broader ecological challenges for the cheetah.

### Potential Impacts
**Habitat Fragmentation and Loss**  
The expansion might involve constructing new infrastructure, such as pumping stations or access roads, which could fragment the cheetah's habitat. This could isolate populations, reducing genetic diversity and making survival more difficult.

**Human-Wildlife Conflict**  
Increased human presence during construction and operation could lead to more encounters with cheetahs, potentially resulting in conflicts, such as livestock predation and retaliatory killings.

**Habitat Degradation**  
Construction activities may cause soil erosion, pollution, and noise, degrading habitat quality and disturbing cheetah behavior, possibly leading to displacement.

**Impact on Prey Species**  
The expansion could affect the habitats of the cheetah's prey, reducing food availability and forcing cheetahs to adapt, which may not be sustainable for their survival.

### Unexpected Detail
An unexpected detail is that while the Asiatic cheetah is currently only found in Iran, historical ranges included the Caucasus, and there are discussions about potential reintroduction in Central Asia, which could make this region relevant for future conservation efforts.

### Survey Note: Detailed Analysis of BTC Pipeline Expansion Impacts on Asiatic Cheetah Habitats

This note provides a comprehensive analysis of the potential cascading effects of the planned expansion of the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) pipeline on the fragmented habitats of the critically endangered Asiatic cheetah, particularly in the southeastern foothills of the Greater Caucasus Mountains. The focus is on increased human-wildlife conflict and habitat degradation due to associated infrastructure development, based on available information and environmental assessments.

#### Background and Context
The BTC pipeline, a 1,768 km crude oil pipeline, connects the Caspian Sea to the Mediterranean, passing through Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Turkey. It became operational in 2006, with a current capacity of 1.2 million barrels per day, expanded in 2009 using drag reducing agents [Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan Pipeline | Who we are | Home](https://www.bp.com/en_ge/georgia/home/who-we-are/btc.html). Recent plans, particularly from Kazakhstan, aim to increase oil exports via the BTC, potentially from 1.5 million tons annually to 20 million tons, as stated by Kazakhstan's Energy Minister in November 2024 [Kazakhstan eyes significant boost in oil exports bypassing Russia | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/kazakhstan-produce-884-mln-tons-oil-this-year-2024-11-25/). This increase, translating to approximately 400,000 barrels per day, suggests potential capacity expansions, possibly involving additional infrastructure like pumping stations.

The Asiatic cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus venaticus) is critically endangered, currently surviving only in Iran, with fewer than 50 individuals estimated in 2017 [Asiatic cheetah - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asiatic_cheetah). Historically, its range included the Caucasus, but it is locally extinct there. The question assumes a population in the southeastern foothills of the Greater Caucasus Mountains, likely a hypothetical or reintroduction scenario, given discussions about reintroducing cheetahs in Central Asia [Talk:Cheetah reintroduction in India - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Cheetah_reintroduction_in_India).

#### Pipeline Expansion Details
The expansion likely involves increasing oil volume through the existing pipeline, potentially requiring upgrades like additional pumping stations. Historical expansions, such as in 2009, used drag reducing agents, but significant volume increases (e.g., to 1.6 million barrels per day) might necessitate physical infrastructure, as suggested by potential capacity increases to 1.9 million barrels per day with more pumping stations [BTC Pipeline Capacity Grows | Energy Intelligence](https://www.energyintel.com/0000017b-a7ae-de4c-a17b-e7eeff680000). Kazakhstan's oil is transported across the Caspian Sea to Azerbaijan, then via BTC, which may involve port and terminal upgrades [Kazakhstan Ships First Kashagan Oil via BTC Pipeline, Expanding Export Routes - Caspian News](https://caspiannews.com/news-detail/kazakhstan-ships-first-kashagan-oil-via-btc-pipeline-expanding-export-routes-2025-1-29-0/).

#### Environmental Impact Assessment
The Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) for the BTC pipeline in Georgia, conducted in 2003, highlighted significant ecological impacts during construction, including habitat loss and fragmentation [Environmental Impact Assessment of BTC oil pipeline | The Corner House](http://www.thecornerhouse.org.uk/resource/environmental-impact-assessment-btc-oil-pipeline). Specific impacts included:

| **Phase**        | **Impact Description**                                                                 | **Specific Locations/KP**                          | **Residual Impact Ranking** | **Mitigation Measures**                                                                                     |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Construction      | Habitat loss and fragmentation due to ROW clearance, affecting forests, wetlands, and alpine meadows | Tetritskaro (KP 84-92), Tsikhisjvari/Sakire (KP 182-204), Mt Tavkvetili (KP 151-157), Kumisi plain (KP 29.4-53.2), Algeti River (KP 53.2-53.8), Bedeni ridge (KP 92-108), Kizil Kilisa (KP 140) | High: Loss of 55 hectares of continuous forest, Caucasian black grouse habitat; Medium: Localized floral species, riparian habitat loss | Pre-clearance surveys (MM1, MM4, MM6), transplant rare species, replant at 1.5:1 ratio (MM2), reinstate with endemic species (MM3), avoid wetlands (MM8), monitor wildlife (MM7), river crossing during low flow (MM8) |
| Operation         | Noise and visual disturbance at pump stations, potential impact on fauna                | Pump Station PSG2, IPSG1, Block Valves G-B12, G-B14, G-B15 | Medium: Noise and visual intrusion in high-value areas | Noise suppression (MM5), vertical diffusion lighting (MM6), fauna monitoring (MM7), landscape screening (MM12) |

The southeastern foothills, likely near Tetritskaro and Kumisi plain (lower KP numbers, closer to Azerbaijan), are within the impacted areas, suggesting similar risks for cheetah habitats.

#### Cascading Effects on Asiatic Cheetah
Given the assumed presence of cheetahs, the expansion could lead to several cascading effects:

1. **Habitat Loss and Fragmentation**: New infrastructure could further divide habitats, isolating cheetah populations. This is critical as cheetahs require large territories (observed to cover over 200 km in Iran [The Asiatic Cheetah: A Subspecies on the Brink of Extinction | Felidae Conservation Fund](https://felidaefund.org/news/general/the-asiatic-cheetah-a-subspecies-on-the-brink-of-extinction)), potentially leading to reduced genetic diversity and inbreeding, increasing extinction risk.

2. **Increased Human-Wildlife Conflict**: Construction and operation phases would increase human presence, potentially leading to more encounters. Cheetahs, if displaced, might prey on livestock, resulting in retaliatory killings, a known issue in Iran [Asiatic Cheetah | Endangered List](https://endangeredlist.org/animal/asiatic-cheetah/). Complaints from Georgian villages, like Tsemi, about water impacts suggest broader community tensions [Georgia: BTC Pipeline-22/Tsemi | Office of the Compliance Advisor/Ombudsman](https://www.cao-ombudsman.org/cases/georgia-btc-pipeline-22tsemi), which could exacerbate conflicts.

3. **Habitat Degradation**: Construction activities, such as soil erosion and pollution, could degrade habitat quality. Noise and visual disturbances from pump stations, rated as medium impact in the ESIA, could disturb cheetah behavior, potentially causing displacement [Extreme Oil . The Journey | PBS](https://www.thirteen.org/wnet/extremeoil/journey/georgia.html).

4. **Impact on Prey Species**: The ESIA notes impacts on riparian and forest habitats, potentially affecting prey like gazelles or urial, historically part of cheetah diets [Animal behavior informed by history: Was the Asiatic cheetah an obligate gazelle hunter? - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10118182/). Reduced prey availability could force cheetahs to travel further, increasing energy expenditure and conflict risks.

5. **Long-Term Population Decline**: The combination of these factors could lead to a decline in cheetah numbers, especially given their critically endangered status. Historical extirpation from the Caucasus due to habitat loss and hunting [Asiatic cheetah - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asiatic_cheetah) suggests vulnerability to similar pressures.

#### Associated Infrastructure Development
The expansion may require additional pumping stations, access roads, and port upgrades, particularly at Sangachal terminal in Azerbaijan. These developments could attract more human settlement and economic activities, further encroaching on cheetah habitats. The ESIA mentions concerns near Borjomi-Kharagauli National Park, indicating potential for broader ecological impacts [Extreme Oil . The Journey | PBS](https://www.thirteen.org/wnet/extremeoil/journey/georgia.html).

#### Mitigation and Considerations
Mitigation measures from the ESIA, such as wildlife monitoring and noise suppression, could help, but their effectiveness for cheetahs, given their specific needs, is uncertain. The lack of current populations in the region complicates direct application, but historical and hypothetical scenarios suggest significant risks.

#### Unexpected Detail
An unexpected detail is the potential for reintroduction discussions in Central Asia, including the Caucasus, as part of broader conservation efforts, which could make this region relevant for future cheetah populations [Talk:Cheetah reintroduction in India - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Cheetah_reintroduction_in_India).

#### Conclusion
The BTC pipeline expansion, while economically beneficial, poses significant risks to the assumed Asiatic cheetah population in the southeastern foothills of the Greater Caucasus Mountains. These risks include habitat fragmentation, increased human-wildlife conflict, degradation, and prey impacts, potentially leading to population decline. Given the cheetah's critical status, careful environmental planning and monitoring are essential.
